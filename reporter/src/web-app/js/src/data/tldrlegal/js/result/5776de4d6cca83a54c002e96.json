The receiving party shall promptly\r\nnotify the disclosing party upon discovery of any loss or unauthorized\r\ndisclosure of disclosing party’s Confidential Information. Whenever\r\nrequested by the disclosing party, the receiving party shall immediately\r\nreturn to the disclosing party all manifestations of its Confidential\r\nInformation or, at the disclosing party’s option, shall destroy all such\r\nConfidential Information as the disclosing party may designate.

Times are\r\nmeasured from time of SBH receipt of an incident report during the stated\r\nsupport hours, and are estimates only.
