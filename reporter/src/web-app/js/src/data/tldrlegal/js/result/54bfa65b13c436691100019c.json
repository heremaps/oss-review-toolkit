  "fulltext": "<h3>Legal Full Terms &amp; Conditions</h3><p>This document, and the documents to which it\nrefers, define the terms of the agreement by which we provide you with\ngoods and/or services.</p><p>These terms are $Revision: 172392 $ $Date: 2015-01-25 16:45:20 +0000 (Sun, 25 Jan 2015) $</p><ul><li>For purchase (and shipping) of goods, our <a>terms for supply\nof goods</a> apply.</li><li>For purchase of services (including ADSL/internet), our <a>terms for supply of services</a> apply.</li><li>For all internet services (including ADSL), our <a>Acceptable Use Policy</a> also applies.</li><li>We also have standard <a>supplier terms</a>.</li></ul><p>If you are not happy with any of the terms or require any clarification\nof the terms please contact us. Whilst this is a <em>standard</em> contract, we are happy to\nconsider changes generally or to meet your specific circumstances.</p><p>Where\nwe agree a variation to this standard agreement it must be in writing\nsigned by a director, or an email electronically signed by a director,\nand such changes will take precedence over these terms.</p><h4>Interpretation</h4><p>This agreement is written in plain English and should be read as such.\nThis agreement is subject to English law.</p><p>We have used the terms <em>we</em>, <em>us</em>, <em>our</em>, etc to mean Andrews &amp;\nArnold Ltd, and <em>you</em>, <em>your</em>, etc to mean the customer to\nwhom we are providing goods and/or services. We are Andrews &amp;\nArnold\nLtd, a company registered in England and Wales number 3342760. For\ninternet services we also trade as AAISP and may also be called A&amp;A.</p><p>We have tried to make the terms in this agreement general and easy to\nunderstand. The terms should be read as a statement of what we intend\nand read to the full extent that the law permits. If a term is\nnot valid in some context, it should be read to the full extent that it\nis valid, or possibly only applying to a narrower context which allows\nit to be valid.</p><h4>Limitations of liability</h4><p>We understand that ongoing operation of goods and/or services we\nprovide can be important to you but we expect you to understand that\nsuch goods and services can fail for a variety of reasons. It is also possible for us to make mistakes. As such we\nexpect you to take whatever precautions or insurances against such\nfailure or mistakes as you see fit, including situations where we may be negligent.\nWe exclude any liability for consequential losses or tort.</p><p>If we are negligent, then we accept that we have\nliability. We require you to prove we have been negligent in such\ncases. We require you to demonstrate actual losses for your claim. We \nrequire you to take all reasonable steps to minimise your losses.</p><p>Whilst there are no limits on our liability for death or personally injury\ndue to negligence,\nwe <strong>limit our liability</strong> for any other negligence or any other reasons to a refund of the amount paid for the failed goods or services.\n(We also make it a condition that you do not use any of our goods or services in any <em>safety of life</em>\n situations where a failure could cause death or personal injury).\nYou agree to this limit whether we are negligent, or not, and even for \nliabilities that somehow occur when we are not in breach of contract \nwith you.</p><p>In the case of on-going services this limit of liability is the \npro-rata\ncharge we have made for the period each specific service was not \nadequately provided, and then only from when the problem was reported to\n us, and only then after allowing reasonable time for us to get the \nproblem rectified.</p><p>If an incident relates to an ongoing service but not a specific time \nframe, then we limit our liability to the charges you have paid for the \nrelated service for a one month period.</p><p>If we are providing a resilient or redundant service package so that \noverall services continue in some way when part of the service fails - \nthen the liability only relates to a period where the service as a whole\n has failed (i.e. all of the redundant parts have failed).</p><p>You agree that our liability is also limited in respect of any claim \nyou make indirectly or via any third party (such as a bank or insurance \ncompany) and agree to indemnify us against charges above that liability \nin any such claim.</p><p>Whilst we may choose to offer a good will credit at our discretion, \nyou agree that if we are not in breach of contract then we have no \nliability to compensate you at all, and that if we are then our \nliability is limited as above. You also agree that the limits of \nliability apply if you take a case to alternative dispute resolution and\n you will not accept any award in excess of these agreed limits. This \ndoes not stop you taking cases to ADR if you are eligible to do so and \nif we have failed to resolve a formal dispute and does not stop you \naccepting any awards that are within what you have agreed as our limit \nof liability in this contract - we are simply expecting you to stick to \nwhat has been agreed, which is the whole point of having a contract.</p><fieldset>\n<legend>Important</legend><p>It is important\nto realise what this means. Basically, in most cases, if we screw up,\nthe most you can get is <strong>your money back</strong>. Some of our services are very\ncheap and some are even free of charge, so this is not a lot of compensation. If this is a problem, then\nyou should look at getting your own insurance or buying services from someone else.\nWhen you order goods or services from us you are agreeing to these limits of liability.\n</p></fieldset><p>These terms do not affect your statutory rights, and apply to the full extent that the law permits them to within those rights.</p><h4>Prices</h4><p>The standard prices for the service are published on our web pages.\nOur web site makes it clear if the prices quoted are inclusive or exclusive of VAT.\nWe show VAT inclusive prices on our web site for services aimed at consumers.</p><p>Consumer invoices normally show VAT inclusive\nprices. Commercial invoices are normally show VAT exclusive unit prices\nwith VAT added to the total at the end. As such the total\nprice for multiple items may differ by a few pence between commercial\nto consumer invoices for the same goods/services.</p><p>The web site is not to be taken as an <em>offer</em> in the contractual sense, but\nis merely an invitation for you to make an offer to purchase goods or\nservices from us, which we may decline for any reason.</p><p>If taking a <em>settlement discount</em> is part of your <em>standard terms</em> and you think we have agreed those <em>standard terms</em> then any prices we quote on the web site or a quotation are those after deduction of your settlement discount.</p><h4>Effect of a VAT rate change</h4><p>Some of our prices are based on a <em>VAT Exclusive</em> value and some of them are based on a <em>VAT Inclusive</em> value. This does <strong>not</strong>\n depend on the way you are billed. If there is a change of VAT rate then\n the price we have for our service does not automatically change. As \nsuch, if a service is based on VAT inclusive value then the VAT \ninclusive price does not change by the VAT exclusive price does. \nSimilarly, if a price is based on VAT exclusive value then the VAT \nexclusive price does not change but the VAT inclusive price does. In the\n event of a significant VAT change we would aim to adjust prices as \nwell, but this may not be at the same time or exactly the same amount. \nWe indicate on the web site where a price shown is VAT inclusive and \nbased on a VAT exclusive value or shown VAT exclusive and based on a VAT\n inclusive value.</p><p>The VAT rate that applies is the VAT rate applicable at the actual tax point of the invoice issued.</p><h4>Periodic Billing</h4><p>For ongoing services we will issue an invoice periodically (e.g. \nmonthly). You may also receive additional bills for one-off charges, \nequipment or other services. We may also issue interim invoices for \nusage based services where the usage has reached a significant level. We\n normally issue invoices in advance on the first day of the period being\n billed. We may issue them several days before the start of the period \ncovered. We have a number of <a>billing options</a>.</p><p>Some older services are provided on a non-refund basis, rather than \n30 days notice. i.e. they have no termination notice period, but any \nperiod already invoiced must be paid. As such, the selection of billing \nperiod may effect the timing or cost of terminating your service, hence \nwe recommend monthly billing rather than quarterly. Where there is a \nnotice period (e.g. 30 days) we will invoice only to the end of the \nnotice period or credit if already billed beyond the notice period.</p><p>We may, in some cases, issue quarterly or annual invoices as 3 or 4 \nseparate invoices issued on the same date with the same terms, one for \neach month or quarter of the period covered. These can be paid with a \nsingle payment. Whilst we normally allow you to choose your billing \nperiod, we can insist on calendar monthly billing if we wish.</p><p>Bills may be for a partial period (e.g. 1.5 months) at the start or \nend of a service, or if changing billing cycle. Whole days are \nconsidered only, with a part day counting as a whole day. A partial bill\n for monthly, quarterly or annual billing considers each day covered to \nbe a proportion of its month (e.g. days in February are 1/28th or 1/29th\n of a month). For billing cycles based on weeks, each day is considered \nto be 1/7th of a week. For lunar bills each day is 1/29th or 1/30th of a\n lunar month based on our calculation of full moon date as the first day\n of the lunar month.</p><h4>Payment<img alt=\"Old £5 note\"></h4><p>You are expected to read the invoices and statements we send you and contact us promptly if you believe there is any error.</p><p>Each invoice states the payment terms, and you must ensure payment \nactually reaches us or our bank within the payment terms. This is your \nresponsibility, so you should allow yourself time to resend payment if \nit is lost in the post or a card payment is not authorised or other such\n eventualities.</p><p>You must ensure your payment quotes our account reference for you \n(e.g. A1234A) as quoted on your invoice and statement.\nThis is to be written on the back of cheques sent, or included as a \npayment reference in any electronic payments. The payment will then be\napplied in full to the one specified account. If you pay by any form of \nbank transfer the date shown on our bank statement is considered to be \nthe date you paid - this is important if using the Fast Payment system \nto send payments late at night or over a weekend as the statement date \nwill be the next banking day. Our staff cannot usually see if you have \nmade a payment until the next working day.</p><p>If you are paying less than £20 per month we expect you to pay by Direct Debit. Some tariffs require Direct Debit payment only.</p><h5>Credit terms</h5><p>Unless we agree otherwise,\ninvoices are due for payment immediately. We are prepared to agree\nterms such as 14 days, 30 days or <em>end\nof following month</em> at our\ndiscretion. Credit is not automatic or a right and we may withdraw or change credit\nterms for future invoices if we wish. If you do not agree to the terms stated on the invoice you must contact us immediately.</p><p>Invoices issued for immediate payment must be paid promptly, and\narrive no later than 7 days from issue of the invoice. We consider this\nto be\nsufficient time for a cheque, <a>BACS</a> transfer, fast payment transfer or other form of payment\neven allowing for public holidays, etc.</p><h5>Clawed back payments</h5><p>With card payments or direct debit payments it is possible for you to <em>claw back</em> or <em>reject</em>\n the payment at a later date. This happens if you ask the bank for a \nrefund for any reason, such as a claim under the Direct Debit guarantee.</p><p>There really should be no reason for a <em>claw back</em> or <em>rejection</em>.\n If we have mistakenly taken payment from you, please contact us and we \nwill immediately return the incorrect payment. We are also happy to pay \nyou any bank charges that you have been charged because of the mistake, \nup to the admin fee we charge (£5.00).</p><p>It is also important to note that any returned or clawed back payment\n is cancelled on your account with us, making it as though the payment \nwas not made at all. You will still owe us for the goods or services \nprovided, and you may become liable for late payment penalties and/or \ninterest, as well as admin fees (see below).</p><h5>Administration fee</h5><p>An administration fee is for extra work or costs we incur because of \nsomething you do that you did not have to do. These are not normally \nnecessary and you can take steps to avoid them in future. We will try \nand work with you to help avoid additional admin fees and we may choose \nto retrospectively credit some fees if you take steps to avoid further \nwork for us.</p><p>We are not trying to be difficult here - all of \nthese reasons for an admin fee are choices you make, and things you do \nnot have to do. They all incur extra work for us that would otherwise be\n unnecessary. It would be unfair to share out these extra costs by \nincreased prices for everyone where the majority of people are able to \navoid us incurring this extra work and costs.</p><p>We may charge you an administration fee, which is normally £5.00+VAT for the following, on each occasion:-</p><ul><li>If you pay by <a>BACS</a> or fast \npayment (electronic banking, standing order) and the payment cannot be \nautomatically processed. e.g. you do not include the correct payment \nreference with the payment. Sending a remittance advice does not help \navoid the administration work for this (in fact, it makes more work for \nus), so please just use the correct payment reference.</li><li>If you pay by cheque. Please note that it is no longer the 19th or 20th century.</li><li>If a cheque is returned unpaid by the bank. This may also result in late payment penalties.</li><li>If you pay by card, and later the card payment is clawed back or you\n attempt to claw back the payment. This applies even if we successfully \ndefend the claw back claim, or the claw back is later returned, as it it\n to cover the admin work involved in doing so. We will also charge any \nfee that we are charged by our bank for the claw back.</li><li>If you pay by direct debit and the payment fails. The exception is \nwhere you can show that we should not have tried to take the payment.</li><li>If you pay by direct debit, and later claw back the payment. The \nexception is where you can show that we should not have taken the \npayement.</li><li>If you ask us to print a paper copy of an invoice or statement and \npost it to you. We send invoices and statements by email, and provide \nthem on line, free of charge.</li><li>If you make an unnecessary payment to us or an overpayment and \nrequire us to return it to you. If the payment involves any special bank\n charges, such as for a high value or same day transfer, we will also \ncharge these. We may deduct all such charges and fees from the repayment\n being sent to you. Any returned payments or balances will normally be \nmade by 2 working day <a>BACS</a> transfer - if you need same day payment an further admin fee will be charged.</li><li>If you send unsolicited commercial emails to any of our system or staff email addresses contrary to these terms or to <a>Section 22 of The Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003</a>,\n or expect us to take any actions relating to such spam then an admin \nfee applies, and we consider our admin fee to be part of our damages as \nper Secion 30 of the regulations. Whilst our domains are used \nexclusively for business purposes, the email services are paid for by \nthe director personally making all of the email addresses those of an \nindividual subscriber and subject to the regulations.</li><li>If you require us to use a third party invoice or payment management\n service then we will charge an admin fee for this (for each time we \nhave to use it) and any additional costs charged by the third party.</li><li>If you send us a bogus invoice which we validly reject (e.g. trying \nto invoice us for a delayed install when we do not guarantee install \ndates). Also for each further exchange of correspondence on such \ninvoices.</li><li>If you attempt to take us to ADR when you are not entitled to (e.g. \nif you have not followed our complaints procedures, or you are a company\n of more than 10 staff, or you are, or have said you are, a \ncommunications provider). We will also charge any fees we end up paying \nas a result of such an attempt if accepted by the ADR provider.</li><li>If you require us to complete surveys or other paperwork or carry \nout additional tests or procedures for compliance or other similar \nprocesses we will charge an hourly rate for this work, please ask for a \nquote.\n</li></ul><p>The admin fee is something of a nominal sum and we suspect our costs are higher on average but only charge £5.00 in the interests of good will. We can, if we wish, charge the full admin fee of £20.00+VAT if you continue cause us extra work. We will advise you if we start charging the full admin fee.</p><h5>Paying by card</h5><p>We do not normally take payment by card, but can do in exceptional \ncircumstances. This can be useful if you need to bring your account up \nto date in order to restore service. You will need to talk to our \naccounts staff to make a card payment, and we will advise you of any \ncard handling fees which apply when you make your payment.</p><h5>Advance payment or over payment</h5><p>If you send us money that you do not owe us,\nsuch as an over payment of a payment when there are no outstanding\ninvoices, then we will hold this as money on your account. You can ask\nfor the credit balance on your account back at any time and as such we \ndo not consider the payment to be an advance payment in respect of \nspecific future goods or services (Value Added Tax Act 1994 section \n6(4)).\nWe do not pay interest on any credit balance. If\nwe invoice you for any goods and services then we will, at that point\nin time, apply any credit balance on your account towards paying that\ninvoice. Your credit balance is not considered a pre-payment for future\ngoods or services.</p><p>If we ask for a deposit with your order, then this is placed on your \naccount as an advance payment. If the order cannot be completed and your\n deposit is refundable then it will be refunded by 2 day <a>BACS</a> bank transfer to you on request. However, we will deduct from the refund any amounts you owe us at that point.</p><h5>Late Payment</h5><p>For <strong>business customers</strong>, late payment interest and\npenalties are\ncharged in accordance with the Late Payment of Commercial Debts\n(Interest) Act 1998 as amended. This is a policy in line with <a>The Better Payment\nPractice Campaign</a> as promoted by H M Revenue &amp; Customs. Note\nthat\nthis includes statutory compensation for late payments between\n£40\nand £100 per late invoice in addition to interest charges at 8%\nabove base lending rates, so it is wise to pay on time. All payments\nreceived are applied on account as the date they are received, clearing\ndebts in strict order of due date. Late payment penalties apply to\nall commercial\ncontracts in the UK, not just us. (<a>more\ngeneral\ninformation</a>)</p><p><strong>Limitations Act</strong>:\n(as with all clauses we expect this clause to be applied to the full extent permitted by law).\nIt is part of our terms that you pay on time, and if you do not then we may <em>charge you</em>\npenalties and interest calculated in accordance with the Late Payment of Commercial Debts\nlegislation. The way in which we <em>charge you</em> is by issue of an\ninvoice detailing the penalties and interest. We may delay issuing such an\ninvoice for any reason and for any length of time, as we wish, and without explanation.\nOnce we issue that invoice you are liable to pay the invoice amount.\nIf you do not pay, then we can take legal action. This action would be for\n<em>non payment of an invoice</em> and the <em>cause of action</em> is the\nissue of the invoice. The date of the cause of action being the date of the invoice,\nand not the date of the original late payment.</p><p>For the purposes of the Late Payment of Commercial Debts (Interest) Act\n1998, where payment is required partly in advance and partly in\narrears,\nsuch as a quarterly invoice on 30 day terms which is 30 days in arrears\nand the rest in advance, then the invoice shall be treated as two\nseparate debts with part payment due for part of the period as per\nsection 11(2) of the Act. Failure to pay for at least the period which\nis in arrears by the due date of the invoice will result in a liability\nfor the £40 to £100 penalty applicable for late payment.</p><p>If we give you time to pay (credit), we are doing this because we\nrecognise that many\nbusinesses have a complex systems for signing off and paying invoices,\nand that people can be on holiday, or sick, etc. It is not because we\nwish to operate as a bank and lend money and it should not be used as a\nmeans to obtain goods and services when you can't afford them. As such\nwe do not expect you to deliberately wait to the last moment you think\nyou can send payment and still be within terms. If you do, and miss the\ndate even by one day we will not have any sympathy with such a policy\nand will charge late payment penalties as the law permits.</p><p><a><img alt=\"DD'\"></a>If\n you pay by Direct Debit, then we are taking responsibility for \ncollecting the payment within the terms. If we do not try and collect \npayment within the terms then you are not liable for late payment \npenalties as a result. However, we are agreeing to try and collect \npayment once within terms. If we try once, and that collection fails for\n any reason or is returned by your bank for any reason, it is then your \nresponsibility to ensure payment is made within the terms. We will \ncontact you if a collection fails. Where the agreed terms allow and \nunless you have picked a fixed date for payments, we will attempt the \nfirst collection in sufficient time to try a second collection within \nthose terms or for you to pay by other means should the first attempt \nfail. It is also important to understand that it takes a few days for a \ndirect debit to be set up, and then you receive 5 working days notice of\n a payment - you must allow for this if setting up a direct debit to pay\n for invoices that will be due before this can be done, and pay any \namounts that will be overdue by other means.</p><p>For <strong>consumers</strong>, we have a consumer credit licence and may give\nyour time to pay as stated on your invoice (e.g. 30 days on quarterly\ninvoiced accounts). Credit given in this way is free of charge (0.0%\nAPR). However, if you default (do not pay within the stated terms) then\nwe will charge you interest on your late payment at the same rate as\ncommercial debts as detailed in the Late Payment of Commercial Debts\n(Interest) Act 1998. We do not however make the fixed penalty charges\nthat is applicable to business customers.</p><h4>Changing terms and prices</h4><p>You cannot change these terms and conditions. You cannot assign\nthis agreement to anyone else without our agreement.\nWe may change the terms and conditions and prices and any associated rules (such as the AUP).\nWe will put the new versions on our web pages.  We may also assign the agreement to any other\nparty after giving you one month's notice.</p><p>For any one-off sale or the start of a new on-going service the terms\n and prices at the time of order apply even if recently changed. We will\n normally advise you of prices when you place the order.</p><h5>Changes that are to your detriment</h5><p>For on-going services, if we make a change that is to your detriment \n(including increasing the price of on-going services more than the \nretail price index) then you have some additional options.</p><ul><li><strong>You can simply accept the changes to terms or prices</strong>: If you \ndo not dispute the change within one month after the change is published\n on the web site, or in the case of a price change of an on-going \nservice then within one month of the new price shown on an invoice, then\n we consider you have accepted the change. To accept the change you do \nnot have to do anything.\n</li><li><strong>You can dispute the change and cease your service</strong>: \nDuring that one month you can dispute the change. If you are within a \nminimum term for a service we can either agree to apply the previous \nterms and prices until the end of the minimum term, or we can allow you \nto cease the service early without penalty, at our choice on a case by \ncase basis. If you are not within a minimum term you can cease the \nservice within one month, and have the previous terms and price apply \nuntil the cease (re-issuing the previous invoice if necessary) but you \nmust request this adjustment within 3 months.</li></ul><h5>When price changes take effect</h5><p>Our standard current price, as published on our web site or as \nadvised to you individually, applies at the time the invoice is raised \nfor the service. The price applies for the whole of the period invoiced.\n This means, for example, if you have quarterly billing then the advance\n charged price for on-going services is fixed for the whole quarter \ninvoiced even if we change prices during that quarter.</p><p>In some cases a special price may apply for a period known in advance\n or a price change may be published in advanced with an applicable date.\n In such cases advance billed charges may be split at the date the price\n change is known to happen.</p><p>The key point here is that the price shown on the invoice is not chanegd retrospectively once the invoice is issued.</p><p>Some customers can be <em>batch billed</em> where proforma invoices are\n raised during the month and these are then included in one big invoice \nat the end of the month. In these cases the price is the one applicable \nwhen the proforma invoice is created. This means the price is the same \nwhether batch billed or normally billed.</p><p>For telephone services the price is that applicable at the time of \nthe call. To be exact: the named rate for the call is the rate \napplicable for the number dialled as at the time the call starts. The \nprice for that named rate is the one applicable at the time the call \nends. The call is broken in to parts for peak, off-peak, and weekend as \napplicable.</p><h4>How we communicate</h4><p>General information, notices and status updates, are made\navailable on our web pages from time to time, including any changes to these terms.</p><p>We may use email to communicate changes, including\nany changes to terms and conditions or policies or other important\ninformation. You must check our web pages, or read email to ensure you\nare aware of such information. If you have a domain from us, you must\naccept and read email directed to <strong>postmaster</strong> at your domain. If\nwe have emailed postmaster at your domain, or the last email address\nyou told us, then notice is considered to\nhave been served. We consider an email to have been sent once passed to \nand accepted by any of the mail servers defined for handling email for \nyour email address. It is up to you to choose mail servers that do not \nthrow away email that they have accepted.</p><p>You may contact us using our published email, \nSMS, Twitter, telephone or postal information. You are responsible for ensuring any\ncommunication actually reaches us, and we consider your communication\nvalid on the date and time it reaches us and not when it was posted or\nsent.\nInvoices and late payment reminders are normally sent by <a>email</a> to the\naddress you have advised to us for your accounts department. You can\nchange the email address to which they are sent whenever you like by\ncontacting us.</p><h4>Customer services and being rude, etc</h4><p>Whilst we will try to provide services with all reasonable skill and care, you agree that <em>customer service</em> is not part of the contract.\nAs a result, it is hereby formally agreed that the total compensation due for any poor customer services experience is zero.</p><p>We expect our staff to always be helpful and polite, and we expect \ncustomers to do likewise. Internally, we set ourselves high standards \nfor customer services. However this is explicitly not part of the \ncontract. If we, or you, are rude or unhelpful then there is \nspecifically zero compensation for this either way in the contract. We \nmay terminate a call or chat if we feel you are being rude, and we would\n happy for you to do the same if staff are rude. We are happy for you to\n provide feedback on such cases and we will endeavor to address them \n(again that is not part of the contract). Just to be clear - we are not \nagreeing to compensate you for causing stress or inconvenience either, \nsorry. What we offer is to provide the services agreed to the level of \nreliability agreed in return for the price agreed - simple.</p><p>The complaints handling procedure is itself a free service we offer, \nand whilst we are happy to take complaints about the complaints handling\n procedure, we consider this to be a <em>customer service</em> issue and so not part of the contract.</p><p><strong>Pre-contract offer</strong>: Prior to forming a contract for goods \nand/or services we offer to provide the worst possible \"customer \nservice\" to you, ignoring you, and being rude and unhelpful. We offer no\n compensation for poor customer service. This may seem like a daft thing\n to say, and we would expect that in practice we will provide much \nbetter service to any prospective customers, but we have this statement \nhere as a point of reference for any dispute regarding <em>customer service</em>\n to anyone who is not yet taking services from us but simply seeking to \ntake services from us. If you want an explanation of this rather odd \noffer, please do contact us on irc and we'll be happy to discuss it.</p><h4>Resolving disputes and arbitration</h4><p>If you have a dispute you must follow our <a>customer complaints code</a>.\n We will try and resolve your dispute promptly and fairly. Please \nremember that the contract terms are key in deciding if you are right or\n wrong, and that you have agreed a limit of liability even if we are \nwrong. Please read the limitations of liability section carefully before\n considering taking any formal action.</p><p>If you are a current customer, and a consumer or small business (10 \nor fewer people working for you) and not a communications provider, and \nfollow our customer complaints code, then we agree that you may take a \ndispute to the arbitrator. Just to be clear, if you are not yet a \ncustomer, or if you are no longer a customer, or if you are not a \nconsumer or small business as defined in the Communications Act, or your\n have not followed our customer complaints code to the point that allows\n use of the arbitrator, then you cannot take a dispute to arbitration. \nYou can only use the arbitrator we specify, which is currently <a>CISAS</a>.\n You also agree, as part of this contract between us and you, that no \narbitrator has the right to decide whether they have jurisdiction \n(Arbitration Act 1996 section 30).</p><p>Either of us can make use of the courts to resolve a dispute. It is \nagreed that English law applies and any dispute will be resolved in the \nEnglish courts if possible. It is agreed that if the claim is within the\n scope of the small claims track process then the small claims courts \nwill be used to resolve the dispute and so minimise costs and risk for \neither side.</p><p>Of course, none of this stops us providing a <em>good will</em> credit to you if there are mistakes or inconvenience, should we wish.  Such a <em>good will</em>\n credit will be in exchange for your agreeing that the dispute is fully \nresolved and that you will not take a matter to arbitration or courts.</p><h4>Liquidation, etc.</h4><p>If you go in to liquidation, administration, bankruptcy or in anyway \nstop being liable to pay your outstanding invoices, then we may \nterminate all services being provided immediately. All goods which have \nnot been paid for in full are ours, and we have the right to collect \nthem from you.</p><p>The person(s) dealing with your company (e.g. liquidator) may ask us \nto continue to provide services. For example, they may want to sell a \nbusiness as a going concern, or sell assets such as domain names. If \nthey do, then they will have to pay all outstanding charges for those \nservices and agree to pay ongoing charges in advance. This is \nparticularly important for domain names. If we terminate domain names \nthen they can be immediately registered by anyone else (including us) \nand become their asset.</p><p>If you take over the business of a company that has gone in to \nliquidation and wish to take over services urgently, we may charge a fee\n for expediting the connection of such services which we decide on a \ncase by case basis.</p><h4>Misc</h4><p>If we don't enforce our contract terms at any point it doesn't mean we won't later.</p><p>If we don't charge you for something right away it doesn't mean we won't charge for it later.</p><p>These terms are not intended to benefit any third party as per Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999.</p><p>If you abuse our FREEPOST address we will charge you our costs plus an admin fee.</p><p>A gigabyte is 1,000,000,000 bytes. A megabyte is 1,000,000 bytes. A \nkilobyte is 1,000 bytes. A megabit/second is 1,000,000 bits per second. \nSee <a>http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/prefixes.html</a> for details. Also <a>xkcd</a> if you find it confusing.</p><p>We may anonymously quote comments from any emails or comments we receive unless you specifically say we can't, e.g. for our <a>testimonials</a> page. We will normally ask first.</p><p>It should not really need saying as it would most probably apply \nunder tort law anyway, but if you deliberately do something knowing it \nwill cost us money, over and above the normal costs for providing the \ngoods or services we supply you, then you have to compensate us for that\n extra cost. For example, if you ask the BT engineer installing your \nline to do some extra work and we get billed by BT for that. This \nincludes any actual costs we may have pursuing a successful court case \nagainst you where they are in excess of the limits permitted by the \nsmall claims court, including staff pay and mileage and other expenses \nwe pay staff at HMRC approved rates.</p>"
