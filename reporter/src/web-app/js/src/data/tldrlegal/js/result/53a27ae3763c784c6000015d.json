Definitions.</p><p>1.1. ``Contributor'' means each entity that creates or contributes to <br>the creation of Modifications.</p><p>1.2. ``Contributor Version'' means the combination of the Original <br>Code, prior Modifications used by a Contributor, and the Modifications <br>made by that particular Contributor.</p><p>1.3. ``Covered Code'' means the Original Code or Modifications or the <br>combination of the Original Code and Modifications, in each case <br>including portions thereof.</p><p>1.4. ``Electronic Distribution Mechanism'' means a mechanism generally <br>accepted in the software development community for the electronic <br>transfer of data.</p><p>1.5. ``Executable'' means Covered Code in any form other than Source <br>Code.</p><p>1.6. ``Initial Developer'' means the individual or entity identified <br>as the Initial Developer in the Source Code notice required by Exhibit <br>A.</p><p>1.7. ``Larger Work'' means a work which combines Covered Code or <br>portions thereof with code not governed by the terms of this License.</p><p>1.8. ``License'' means this document.</p><p>1.9. ``Modifications'' means any addition to or deletion from the <br>substance or structure of either the Original Code or any previous <br>Modifications. When Covered Code is released as a series of files, a <br>Modification is:</p><p>A. Any addition to or deletion from the contents of a file containing <br>Original Code or previous Modifications.</p><p>B. Any new file that contains any part of the Original Code or <br>previous Modifications.</p><p>1.10. ``Original Code'' means Source Code of computer software code <br>which is described in the Source Code notice required by Exhibit A as <br>Original Code, and which, at the time of its release under this <br>License is not already Covered Code governed by this License.</p><p>1.11. ``Source Code'' means the preferred form of the Covered Code for <br>making modifications to it, including all modules it contains, plus <br>any associated interface definition files, scripts used to control <br>compilation and installation of an Executable, or a list of source <br>code differential comparisons against either the Original Code or <br>another well known, available Covered Code of the Contributor's <br>choice. The Source Code can be in a compressed or archival form, <br>provided the appropriate decompression or de-archiving software is <br>widely available for no charge.</p><p>1.12. ``You'' means an individual or a legal entity exercising rights <br>under, and complying with all of the terms of, this License. For legal <br>entities,``You'' includes any entity which controls, is controlled by, <br>or is under common control with You. For purposes of this definition, <br>``control'' means (a) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the <br>direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or <br>otherwise, or (b) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the <br>outstanding shares or beneficial ownership of such entity.</p><p>2. Source Code License.</p><p>2.1. The Initial Developer Grant. <br>The Initial Developer hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, <br>non-exclusive license, subject to third party intellectual property <br>claims:</p><p>(a) to use, reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense and <br>distribute the Original Code (or portions thereof) with or without <br>Modifications, or as part of a Larger Work; and</p><p>(b) under patents now or hereafter owned or controlled by Initial <br>Developer, to make, have made, use and sell (``Utilize'') the <br>Original Code (or portions thereof), but solely to the extent that <br>any such patent is reasonably necessary to enable You to Utilize <br>the Original Code (or portions thereof) and not to any greater <br>extent that may be necessary to Utilize further Modifications or <br>combinations.</p><p>2.2. Contributor Grant. <br>Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, <br>non-exclusive license, subject to third party intellectual property <br>claims:</p><p>(a) to use, reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense and <br>distribute the Modifications created by such Contributor (or <br>portions thereof) either on an unmodified basis, with other <br>Modifications, as Covered Code or as part of a Larger Work; and</p><p>(b) under patents now or hereafter owned or controlled by Contributor, <br>to Utilize the Contributor Version (or portions thereof), but <br>solely to the extent that any such patent is reasonably necessary <br>to enable You to Utilize the Contributor Version (or portions <br>thereof), and not to any greater extent that may be necessary to <br>Utilize further Modifications or combinations.</p><p>3. Distribution Obligations.</p><p>3.1. Application of License. <br>The Modifications which You contribute are governed by the terms of <br>this License, including without limitation Section 2.2. The Source <br>Code version of Covered Code may be distributed only under the terms <br>of this License, and You must include a copy of this License with <br>every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or <br>impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or restricts <br>the applicable version of this License or the recipients' rights <br>hereunder. However, You may include an additional document offering <br>the additional rights described in Section 3.5.</p><p>3.2. Availability of Source Code. <br>Any Modification which You contribute must be made available in Source <br>Code form under the terms of this License either on the same media as <br>an Executable version or via an accepted Electronic Distribution <br>Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable version available; <br>and if made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must <br>remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it <br>initially became available, or at least six (6) months after a <br>subsequent version of that particular Modification has been made <br>available to such recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that <br>the Source Code version remains available even if the Electronic <br>Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.</p><p>3.3. Description of Modifications. <br>You must cause all Covered Code to which you contribute to contain a <br>file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and <br>the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that <br>the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original <br>Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the <br>Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an <br>Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the <br>origin or ownership of the Covered Code.</p><p>3.4. Intellectual Property Matters</p><p>(a) Third Party Claims. <br>If You have knowledge that a party claims an intellectual property <br>right in particular functionality or code (or its utilization <br>under this License), you must include a text file with the source <br>code distribution titled ``LEGAL'' which describes the claim and <br>the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient <br>will know whom to contact. If you obtain such knowledge after You <br>make Your Modification available as described in Section 3.2, You <br>shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies You make <br>available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying <br>appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to <br>inform those who received the Covered Code that new knowledge has <br>been obtained.</p><p>(b) Contributor APIs. <br>If Your Modification is an application programming interface and <br>You own or control patents which are reasonably necessary to <br>implement that API, you must also include this information in the <br>LEGAL file.</p><p>3.5. Required Notices. <br>You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source <br>Code, and this License in any documentation for the Source Code, where <br>You describe recipients' rights relating to Covered Code. If You <br>created one or more Modification(s), You may add your name as a <br>Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. If it is not <br>possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to <br>its structure, then you must include such notice in a location (such <br>as a relevant directory file) where a user would be likely to look for <br>such a notice. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, <br>warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more <br>recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own <br>behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any <br>Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty, <br>support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, <br>and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every <br>Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or <br>such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or <br>liability terms You offer.</p><p>3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions. <br>You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the <br>requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, <br>and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of <br>the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License, <br>including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the <br>obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included <br>in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or <br>collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the <br>Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered <br>Code under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different <br>from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms <br>of this License and that the license for the Executable version does <br>not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source <br>Code version from the rights set forth in this License. If You <br>distribute the Executable version under a different license You must <br>make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License <br>are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any <br>Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and <br>every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer <br>or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.</p><p>3.7. Larger Works. <br>You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code <br>not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger <br>Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the <br>requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.</p><p>4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation. <br>If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this <br>License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute <br>or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License <br>to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and <br>the code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL <br>file described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all <br>distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by <br>statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed <br>for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.</p><p>5. Application of this License.</p><p>This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has <br>attached the notice in Exhibit A, and to related Covered Code.</p><p>6. CONNECTION TO MOZILLA PUBLIC LICENSE</p><p>This Erlang License is a derivative work of the Mozilla Public <br>License, Version 1.0. It contains terms which differ from the Mozilla <br>Public License, Version 1.0.</p><p>7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.</p><p>COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN ``AS IS'' BASIS, <br>WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, <br>WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF <br>DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR <br>NON-INFRINGING.

THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART <br>OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER <br>EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.</p><p>8. TERMINATION. <br>This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate <br>automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure <br>such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All <br>sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall <br>survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their <br>nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License <br>shall survive.</p><p>9. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY <br>Any utilization of Covered Code shall not cause the Initial Developer <br>or any Contributor to be liable for any damages (neither direct nor <br>indirect).</p><p>10. MISCELLANEOUS <br>This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject <br>matter hereof. If any provision is held to be unenforceable, such <br>provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it <br>enforceable. This License shall be construed by and in accordance with <br>the substantive laws of Sweden. Any dispute, controversy or claim <br>arising out of or relating to this License, or the breach, termination <br>or invalidity thereof, shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction <br>of Swedish courts, with the Stockholm City Court as the first <br>instance.</p><p>EXHIBIT A.</p><p>``The contents of this file are subject to the Erlang Public License, <br>Version 1.1, (the \"License\"); you may not use this file except in <br>compliance with the License.
