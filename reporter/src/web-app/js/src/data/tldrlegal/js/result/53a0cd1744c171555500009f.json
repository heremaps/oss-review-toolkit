(But if you find any bugs, <br>please let us know!) <br>2. You can use this software for whatever you want. You don't have to pay us. <br>3. You may not pretend that you wrote this software. If you use it in a <br>program, you must acknowledge somewhere in your documentation that <br>you've used the IJG code.</p><p>In legalese:</p><p>The authors make NO WARRANTY or representation, either express or implied, <br>with respect to this software, its quality, accuracy, merchantability, or <br>fitness for a particular purpose. This software is provided \"AS IS\", and you, <br>its user, assume the entire risk as to its quality and accuracy.</p><p>This software is copyright (C) 1991-1998, Thomas G. Lane. <br>All Rights Reserved except as specified below.</p><p>Permission is hereby granted to use, copy, modify, and distribute this <br>software (or portions thereof) for any purpose, without fee, subject to these <br>conditions: <br>(1) If any part of the source code for this software is distributed, then this <br>README file must be included, with this copyright and no-warranty notice <br>unaltered; and any additions, deletions, or changes to the original files <br>must be clearly indicated in accompanying documentation. <br>(2) If only executable code is distributed, then the accompanying <br>documentation must state that \"this software is based in part on the work of <br>the Independent JPEG Group\". <br>(3) Permission for use of this software is granted only if the user accepts <br>full responsibility for any undesirable consequences; the authors accept <br>NO LIABILITY for damages of any kind.</p><p>These conditions apply to any software derived from or based on the IJG code, <br>not just to the unmodified library. If you use our work, you ought to <br>acknowledge us.</p><p>Permission is NOT granted for the use of any IJG author's name or company name <br>in advertising or publicity relating to this software or products derived from <br>it. This software may be referred to only as \"the Independent JPEG Group's <br>software\".</p><p>We specifically permit and encourage the use of this software as the basis of <br>commercial products, provided that all warranty or liability claims are <br>assumed by the product vendor.</p><p><br>ansi2knr.c is included in this distribution by permission of L. Peter Deutsch, <br>sole proprietor of its copyright holder, Aladdin Enterprises of Menlo Park, CA. <br>ansi2knr.c is NOT covered by the above copyright and conditions, but instead <br>by the usual distribution terms of the Free Software Foundation; principally, <br>that you must include source code if you redistribute it. (See the file <br>ansi2knr.c for full details.) However, since ansi2knr.c is not needed as part <br>of any program generated from the IJG code, this does not limit you more than <br>the foregoing paragraphs do.</p><p>The Unix configuration script \"configure\" was produced with GNU Autoconf. <br>It is copyright by the Free Software Foundation but is freely distributable. <br>The same holds for its supporting scripts (config.guess, config.sub, <br>ltconfig, ltmain.sh). Another support script, install-sh, is copyright <br>by M.I.T. but is also freely distributable.</p><p>It appears that the arithmetic coding option of the JPEG spec is covered by <br>patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi. Hence arithmetic coding cannot <br>legally be used without obtaining one or more licenses. For this reason, <br>support for arithmetic coding has been removed from the free JPEG software. <br>(Since arithmetic coding provides only a marginal gain over the unpatented <br>Huffman mode, it is unlikely that very many implementations will support it.) <br>So far as we are aware, there are no patent restrictions on the remaining <br>code.</p><p>The IJG distribution formerly included code to read and write GIF files. <br>To avoid entanglement with the Unisys LZW patent, GIF reading support has <br>been removed altogether, and the GIF writer has been simplified to produce <br>\"uncompressed GIFs\". This technique does not use the LZW algorithm; the <br>resulting GIF files are larger than usual, but are readable by all standard <br>GIF decoders.</p><p>We are required to state that <br>\"The Graphics Interchange Format(c) is the Copyright property of <br>CompuServe Incorporated. GIF(sm) is a Service Mark property of <br>CompuServe Incorporated.\"</p>"
