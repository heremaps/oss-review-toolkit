  "fulltext": "<p>The FreeType Project LICENSE&nbsp;</p><p>----------------------------\r\n</p><p>2006-Jan-27</p><p>Copyright 1996-2002, 2006 by <br>David Turner, Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg</p><p>Introduction <br>============</p><p>The FreeType Project is distributed in several archive packages; <br>some of them may contain, in addition to the FreeType font engine, <br>various tools and contributions which rely on, or relate to, the <br>FreeType Project.</p><p>This license applies to all files found in such packages, and <br>which do not fall under their own explicit license. The license <br>affects thus the FreeType font engine, the test programs, <br>documentation and makefiles, at the very least.</p><p>This license was inspired by the BSD, Artistic, and IJG <br>(Independent JPEG Group) licenses, which all encourage inclusion <br>and use of free software in commercial and freeware products <br>alike. As a consequence, its main points are that:</p><p>o We don't promise that this software works. However, we will be <br>interested in any kind of bug reports. (`as is' distribution)</p><p>o You can use this software for whatever you want, in parts or <br>full form, without having to pay us. (`royalty-free' usage)</p><p>o You may not pretend that you wrote this software. If you use <br>it, or only parts of it, in a program, you must acknowledge <br>somewhere in your documentation that you have used the <br>FreeType code. (`credits')</p><p>We specifically permit and encourage the inclusion of this <br>software, with or without modifications, in commercial products. <br>We disclaim all warranties covering The FreeType Project and <br>assume no liability related to The FreeType Project.</p><p><br>Finally, many people asked us for a preferred form for a <br>credit/disclaimer to use in compliance with this license. We thus <br>encourage you to use the following text:</p><p>\"\"\" <br>Portions of this software are copyright &copy; &lt;year&gt; The FreeType <br>Project (www.freetype.org). All rights reserved. <br>\"\"\"</p><p>Please replace &lt;year&gt; with the value from the FreeType version you <br>actually use.</p><p><br>Legal Terms <br>===========</p><p>0. Definitions <br>--------------</p><p>Throughout this license, the terms `package', `FreeType Project', <br>and `FreeType archive' refer to the set of files originally <br>distributed by the authors (David Turner, Robert Wilhelm, and <br>Werner Lemberg) as the `FreeType Project', be they named as alpha, <br>beta or final release.</p><p>`You' refers to the licensee, or person using the project, where <br>`using' is a generic term including compiling the project's source <br>code as well as linking it to form a `program' or `executable'. <br>This program is referred to as `a program using the FreeType <br>engine'.</p><p>This license applies to all files distributed in the original <br>FreeType Project, including all source code, binaries and <br>documentation, unless otherwise stated in the file in its <br>original, unmodified form as distributed in the original archive. <br>If you are unsure whether or not a particular file is covered by <br>this license, you must contact us to verify this.</p><p>The FreeType Project is copyright (C) 1996-2000 by David Turner, <br>Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg. All rights reserved except as <br>specified below.</p><p>1. No Warranty <br>--------------</p><p>THE FREETYPE PROJECT IS PROVIDED `AS IS' WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY <br>KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, <br>WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR <br>PURPOSE. IN NO EVENT WILL ANY OF THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS <br>BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES CAUSED BY THE USE OR THE INABILITY TO <br>USE, OF THE FREETYPE PROJECT.</p><p>2. Redistribution <br>-----------------</p><p>This license grants a worldwide, royalty-free, perpetual and <br>irrevocable right and license to use, execute, perform, compile, <br>display, copy, create derivative works of, distribute and <br>sublicense the FreeType Project (in both source and object code <br>forms) and derivative works thereof for any purpose; and to <br>authorize others to exercise some or all of the rights granted <br>herein, subject to the following conditions:</p><p>o Redistribution of source code must retain this license file <br>(`FTL.TXT') unaltered; any additions, deletions or changes to <br>the original files must be clearly indicated in accompanying <br>documentation. The copyright notices of the unaltered, <br>original files must be preserved in all copies of source <br>files.</p><p>o Redistribution in binary form must provide a disclaimer that <br>states that the software is based in part of the work of the <br>FreeType Team, in the distribution documentation. We also <br>encourage you to put an URL to the FreeType web page in your <br>documentation, though this isn't mandatory.</p><p>These conditions apply to any software derived from or based on <br>the FreeType Project, not just the unmodified files. If you use <br>our work, you must acknowledge us. However, no fee need be paid <br>to us.</p><p>3. Advertising <br>--------------</p><p>Neither the FreeType authors and contributors nor you shall use <br>the name of the other for commercial, advertising, or promotional <br>purposes without specific prior written permission.</p><p>We suggest, but do not require, that you use one or more of the <br>following phrases to refer to this software in your documentation <br>or advertising materials: `FreeType Project', `FreeType Engine', <br>`FreeType library', or `FreeType Distribution'.</p><p>As you have not signed this license, you are not required to <br>accept it. However, as the FreeType Project is copyrighted <br>material, only this license, or another one contracted with the <br>authors, grants you the right to use, distribute, and modify it. <br>Therefore, by using, distributing, or modifying the FreeType <br>Project, you indicate that you understand and accept all the terms <br>of this license.</p><p>4. Contacts <br>-----------</p><p>There are two mailing lists related to FreeType:</p><p>o freetype@nongnu.org</p><p>Discusses general use and applications of FreeType, as well as <br>future and wanted additions to the library and distribution. <br>If you are looking for support, start in this list if you <br>haven't found anything to help you in the documentation.</p><p>o freetype-devel@nongnu.org</p><p>Discusses bugs, as well as engine internals, design issues, <br>specific licenses, porting, etc.</p><p>Our home page can be found at</p><p>http://www.freetype.org</p><p><br>--- end of FTL.TXT ---</p>"
