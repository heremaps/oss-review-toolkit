  "fulltext": "<h1>Open Software License v. 3.0 (OSL-3.0)</h1><p>This Open Software License (the \"License\") applies to any \r\noriginal work of authorship (the \"Original Work\") whose owner (the \r\n\"Licensor\") has placed the following licensing notice adjacent to the \r\ncopyright notice for the Original Work:</p><p>Licensed under the Open Software License version 3.0</p><p>1) <strong>Grant of Copyright License.</strong> Licensor grants You a \r\nworldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, sublicensable license, for the \r\nduration of the copyright, to do the following:</p><p>a) to reproduce the Original Work in copies, either alone or as part of a collective work;</p><p>b) to translate, adapt, alter, transform, modify, or arrange the \r\nOriginal Work, thereby creating derivative works (\"Derivative Works\") \r\nbased upon the Original Work;</p><p>c) to distribute or communicate copies of the Original Work and Derivative Works to the public, <u>with\r\n the proviso that copies of Original Work or Derivative Works that You \r\ndistribute or communicate shall be licensed under this Open Software \r\nLicense</u>;</p><p>d) to perform the Original Work publicly; and</p><p>e) to display the Original Work publicly.</p><p>2) <strong>Grant</strong> of Patent License. Licensor grants You a \r\nworldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, sublicensable license, under \r\npatent claims owned or controlled by the Licensor that are embodied in \r\nthe Original Work as furnished by the Licensor, for the duration of the \r\npatents, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, and import the \r\nOriginal Work and Derivative Works.</p><p>3) <strong>Grant</strong> of Source Code License. The term \"Source Code\" \r\nmeans the preferred form of the Original Work for making modifications \r\nto it and all available documentation describing how to modify the \r\nOriginal Work. Licensor agrees to provide a machine-readable copy of the\r\n Source Code of the Original Work along with each copy of the Original \r\nWork that Licensor distributes. Licensor reserves the right to satisfy \r\nthis obligation by placing a machine-readable copy of the Source Code in\r\n an information repository reasonably calculated to permit inexpensive \r\nand convenient access by You for as long as Licensor continues to \r\ndistribute the Original Work.</p><p>4) <strong>Exclusions From License Grant.</strong> Neither the names of \r\nLicensor, nor the names of any contributors to the Original Work, nor \r\nany of their trademarks or service marks, may be used to endorse or \r\npromote products derived from this Original Work without express prior \r\npermission of the Licensor. Except as expressly stated herein, nothing \r\nin this License grants any license to Licensor's trademarks, copyrights,\r\n patents, trade secrets or any other intellectual property. No patent \r\nlicense is granted to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, or \r\nimport embodiments of any patent claims other than the licensed claims \r\ndefined in Section 2. No license is granted to the trademarks of \r\nLicensor even if such marks are included in the Original Work. Nothing \r\nin this License shall be interpreted to prohibit Licensor from licensing\r\n under terms different from this License any Original Work that Licensor\r\n otherwise would have a right to license.</p><p>5) <strong>External Deployment.</strong> The term \"External Deployment\" \r\nmeans the use, distribution, or communication of the Original Work or \r\nDerivative Works in any way such that the Original Work or Derivative \r\nWorks may be used by anyone other than You, whether those works are \r\ndistributed or communicated to those persons or made available as an \r\napplication intended for use over a network. As an express condition for\r\n the grants of license hereunder, You must treat any External Deployment\r\n by You of the Original Work or a Derivative Work as a distribution \r\nunder section 1(c).</p><p>6) <strong>Attribution Rights.</strong> You must retain, in the Source Code\r\n of any Derivative Works that You create, all copyright, patent, or \r\ntrademark notices from the Source Code of the Original Work, as well as \r\nany notices of licensing and any descriptive text identified therein as \r\nan \"Attribution Notice.\" You must cause the Source Code for any \r\nDerivative Works that You create to carry a prominent Attribution Notice\r\n reasonably calculated to inform recipients that You have modified the \r\nOriginal Work.</p><p>7) <strong>Warranty of Provenance and Disclaimer of Warranty.</strong> \r\nLicensor warrants that the copyright in and to the Original Work and the\r\n patent rights granted herein by Licensor are owned by the Licensor or \r\nare sublicensed to You under the terms of this License with the \r\npermission of the contributor(s) of those copyrights and patent rights. \r\nExcept as expressly stated in the immediately preceding sentence, the \r\nOriginal Work is provided under this License on an \"AS IS\" BASIS and \r\nWITHOUT WARRANTY, either express or implied, including, without \r\nlimitation, the warranties of non-infringement, merchantability or \r\nfitness for a particular purpose. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY OF \r\nTHE ORIGINAL WORK IS WITH YOU. This DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY constitutes \r\nan essential part of this License. No license to the Original Work is \r\ngranted by this License except under this disclaimer.</p><p>8) <strong>Limitation of Liability.</strong> Under no circumstances and \r\nunder no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract,\r\n or otherwise, shall the Licensor be liable to anyone for any indirect, \r\nspecial, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising \r\nas a result of this License or the use of the Original Work including, \r\nwithout limitation, damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, \r\ncomputer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages\r\n or losses. This limitation of liability shall not apply to the extent \r\napplicable law prohibits such limitation.</p><p>9) <strong>Acceptance and Termination.</strong> If, at any time, You \r\nexpressly assented to this License, that assent indicates your clear and\r\n irrevocable acceptance of this License and all of its terms and \r\nconditions. If You distribute or communicate copies of the Original Work\r\n or a Derivative Work, You must make a reasonable effort under the \r\ncircumstances to obtain the express assent of recipients to the terms of\r\n this License. This License conditions your rights to undertake the \r\nactivities listed in Section 1, including your right to create \r\nDerivative Works based upon the Original Work, and doing so without \r\nhonoring these terms and conditions is prohibited by copyright law and \r\ninternational treaty. Nothing in this License is intended to affect \r\ncopyright exceptions and limitations (including \"fair use\" or \"fair \r\ndealing\"). This License shall terminate immediately and You may no \r\nlonger exercise any of the rights granted to You by this License upon \r\nyour failure to honor the conditions in Section 1(c).</p><p>10) <strong>Termination for Patent Action.</strong> This License shall \r\nterminate automatically and You may no longer exercise any of the rights\r\n granted to You by this License as of the date You commence an action, \r\nincluding a cross-claim or counterclaim, against Licensor or any \r\nlicensee alleging that the Original Work infringes a patent. This \r\ntermination provision shall not apply for an action alleging patent \r\ninfringement by combinations of the Original Work with other software or\r\n hardware.</p><p>11) <strong>Jurisdiction, Venue and Governing Law.</strong> Any action or \r\nsuit relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of a \r\njurisdiction wherein the Licensor resides or in which Licensor conducts \r\nits primary business, and under the laws of that jurisdiction excluding \r\nits conflict-of-law provisions. The application of the United Nations \r\nConvention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly\r\n excluded. Any use of the Original Work outside the scope of this \r\nLicense or after its termination shall be subject to the requirements \r\nand penalties of copyright or patent law in the appropriate \r\njurisdiction. This section shall survive the termination of this \r\nLicense.</p><p>12) <strong>Attorneys' Fees.</strong> In any action to enforce the terms of\r\n this License or seeking damages relating thereto, the prevailing party \r\nshall be entitled to recover its costs and expenses, including, without \r\nlimitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and costs incurred in connection \r\nwith such action, including any appeal of such action. This section \r\nshall survive the termination of this License.</p><p>13) <strong>Miscellaneous.</strong> If any provision of this License is \r\nheld to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the \r\nextent necessary to make it enforceable.</p><p>14) <strong>Definition of \"You\" in This License.</strong> \"You\" throughout \r\nthis License, whether in upper or lower case, means an individual or a \r\nlegal entity exercising rights under, and complying with all of the \r\nterms of, this License. For legal entities, \"You\" includes any entity \r\nthat controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with you. \r\nFor purposes of this definition, \"control\" means (i) the power, direct \r\nor indirect, to cause the direction or management of such entity, \r\nwhether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent \r\n(50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership \r\nof such entity.</p><p>15) <strong>Right to Use.</strong> You may use the Original Work in all \r\nways not otherwise restricted or conditioned by this License or by law, \r\nand Licensor promises not to interfere with or be responsible for such \r\nuses by You.</p><p>16) <strong>Modification of This License.</strong> This License \r\nis Copyright &copy; 2005 Lawrence Rosen. Permission is granted to copy, \r\ndistribute, or communicate this License without modification. Nothing in\r\n this License permits You to modify this License as applied to the \r\nOriginal Work or to Derivative Works. However, You may modify the text \r\nof this License and copy, distribute or communicate your modified \r\nversion (the \"Modified License\") and apply it to other original works of\r\n authorship subject to the following conditions: (i) You may not \r\nindicate in any way that your Modified License is the \"Open Software \r\nLicense\" or \"OSL\" and you may not use those names in the name of your \r\nModified License; (ii) You must replace the notice specified in the \r\nfirst paragraph above with the notice \"Licensed under &lt;insert your \r\nlicense name here&gt;\" or with a notice of your own that is not \r\nconfusingly similar to the notice in this License; and (iii) You may not\r\n claim that your original works are open source software unless your \r\nModified License has been approved by Open Source Initiative (OSI) and \r\nYou comply with its license review and certification process.</p>"
