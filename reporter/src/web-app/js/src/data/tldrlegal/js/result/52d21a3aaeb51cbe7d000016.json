PREAMBLE</p><p>The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other functional and useful document \"free\" in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially. Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for modifications made by others.</p><p>This License is a kind of \"copyleft\", which means that derivative works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense. It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft license designed for free software.</p><p>We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free software, because free software needs free documentation: a free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the software does. But this License is not limited to software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book. We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.</p><p>http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.</p><p>Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the Document specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of this License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Document.</p><p>11. RELICENSING</p><p>\"Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site\" (or \"MMC Site\") means any World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works. A public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server. A \"Massive Multiauthor Collaboration\" (or \"MMC\") contained in the site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC site.</p><p>\"CC-BY-SA\" means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco, California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license published by that same organization.</p><p>\"Incorporate\" means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or in part, as part of another Document.</p><p>An MMC is \"eligible for relicensing\" if it is licensed under this License, and if all works that were first published under this License somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently incorporated in whole or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover texts or invariant sections, and (2) were thus incorporated prior to November 1, 2008.</p><p>The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the site under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1, 2009, provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.</p><p>ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents</p><p>To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of the License in the document and put the following copyright and license notices just after the title page:</p><p>    Copyright (C)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.</p><p>    Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document</p><p>    under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3</p><p>    or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;</p><p>    with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts.</p><p>    A copy of the license is included in the section entitled \"GNU</p><p>    Free Documentation License\".</p><p>If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts, replace the \"with â€¦ Texts.\" line with this:</p><p>    with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the</p><p>    Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.</p><p>If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the situation.</p><p>If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of free software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to permit their use in free software.&nbsp;</p>"
