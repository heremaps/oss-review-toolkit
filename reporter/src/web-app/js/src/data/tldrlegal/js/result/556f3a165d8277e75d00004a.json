Definitions<br>--------------</p><p>   a. \"Licensor\" means the individual, individuals,<br>       entity or entities that offer(s) the Work under<br>       the terms of this License.</p><p>   b. \"Distribute\" means to make available to the<br>       public the original and copies of the Work or<br>       Adaptation, as appropriate, through sale or<br>       other transfer of ownership.</p><p>   c. \"Original author\" means the individual,<br>       individuals, entity or entities that originally<br>       created the Work.</p><p>   d. \"Work\" means the stuff that you didn't make,<br>       was created by the Original author(s) and you<br>       don't own. Includes anything distributed as<br>       part of the package, be it software, written<br>       works or digital media. Movies and music. That<br>       kind of stuff.</p><p>2. License grant<br>----------------</p><p>You (the Licensor) can do whatever the fuck you want. The<br>Author simply doesn't care about what you do with it. Ever<br>wonder what IDGAF stands for, anyways? Well, wonder no<br>more:</p><p>   * I<br>   * Don't<br>   * Give<br>   * A<br>   * Fuck</p><p>Basically, as long as you mention the Original author and<br>send a beer/cookie his/her way, we'll all be fine. If you<br>don't, we know people in low places. People that can come<br>into your house at night. People that know your family.<br>People that can do stuff. Like my friend Carlos. He can<br>do stuff.</p><p>Nasty stuff.</p><p>Stuff you wouldn't want happening. Capisce?</p><p>3. Restrictions<br>---------------</p><p>You're not allowed to bitch about the Work. Not ever.<br>Don't whine about how bad the memory leaks are or how<br>the storyline sucks. If you don't like it, change it or<br>stop using it.</p><p>Face it. Noone gives a fuck. Do better or shut the fuck<br>up.</p><p>You're free to compliment the Original author on his<br>choice of wardrobe, though. Also, it helps to compliment<br>the Author on his/her good hair day and perfect abs.</p><p>Donations are also an acceptable forms of praise.</p><p>4. Liability<br>------------</p><p>The Author disclaims any liability regarding the use of<br>the work provided.</p><p>Seriously, none. No claims are made regarding the<br>usefulness or safety of the Work.</p><p>If you manage to blow yourself up using this Work, the<br>Author will applaud your commitment to getting your<br>name on the Darwin Awards list.</p><p>Expect no mercy or sympathy.</p><p>5. Termination<br>--------------</p><p>The License and the rights granted will terminate<br>automatically upon any breach by the Licensor. This<br>includes bitching, whining and tormenting the Author<br>with inane questions already answered elsewhere,<br>like, you know... Teh Interwebs. Stuff like:</p><p><a href=\"http://letmegooglethatforyou.com/?q=how+to+use+google\">http://letmegooglethatforyou.com/?q=how+to+use+google</a></p><p>And use that thing growing vertically upwards out of<br>your thorax. I know it hurts sometimes. But you get<br>used to it. Eventually.</p><p>6. Miscellaneous<br>----------------</p><p>Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work<br>or a Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient<br>a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions<br>as the license granted to You under this License.</p><p>Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an<br>Adaptation, Licensor offers to the recipient a license<br>to the original Work on the same terms and conditions<br>as the license granted to You under this License.</p><p>In layman's terms - give it like you got it.</p>"
