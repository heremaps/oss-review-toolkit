In order to qualify to receive any Service Guarantee Payment, in addition to meeting the conditions set forth in this Agreement that relate specifically to the type of Service Guarantee in question, you must also fully meet the following conditions:<br>(a)\tthe relevant Customer Device must have an active, paid-for Service Term (at the time of its loss or theft) in respect of an edition of the Service that you have purchased which includes a Service Guarantee; <br>(b)\tthe loss of the Customer Device must not have been a Restricted Loss;<br>(c)\tyou must be in full compliance with your obligations under this Agreement including, without limitation, your obligation to submit a fully-completed Theft Report no later than fourteen (14) days after the Theft Date;<br>(d)\tthe Customer Device must have contacted the Monitoring Center within 90 days before the Theft Date; <br>(e)\tif the Customer Device is an Android device, the Customer Device must be a device that is capable of supporting persistence for the edition of the Service purchased by you and persistence must have been enabled on the Customer Device at the time of the loss or theft. A list of devices that are capable of supporting persistence is available from Absolute or Online; <br>(f)\tif the Customer Device is an Android device, you must not have obtained root access to the operating system or “rooted” the Customer Device prior to the time of the loss or theft;<br>(g)\tif the Customer Device is a Chromebook, and if a version of Chrome OS becomes available that is capable of supporting Google’s Forced Re-Enrollment Feature for the edition of the Service purchased by you, within thirty (30) days of such version becoming available you must have upgraded the Customer Device to that version and enabled Google’s Forced Re-Enrollment Feature. If you fail to do so, the theft or loss of your Customer Device will be a Restricted Loss;<br>(h)\tyou must not have transferred the Service Term containing the Theft Recovery feature to the Customer Device in question during the restricted periods set out in Section 9(d) above of Appendix “A”;<br>(i)\tthe Customer Device must have been stolen or lost (as determined reasonably by Absolute) from inside of the Service Guarantee Territory,<br>(j)\tyou must not have launched or executed a service or feature on your Customer Device (for example, a Data Delete Operation or a Locking Operation whether launched manually or automatically upon the expiration of a timer) that restricts or disables the ability of your Customer Device to contact the Monitoring Center;<br>(k)\tif Intel AT is activated on the Customer Device, you must log into Customer Center and elect to de-enroll or de-activate Intel AT for that Customer Device on or before submitting a Theft Report and the Customer Device must successfully de-enroll or de-activate Intel AT so that Intel AT cannot launch a Locking Operation automatically;<br>(l)\tif you have a consumer edition of the Service, you must, no later than thirty (30) days after the applicable Service Guarantee Period has ended, duly complete and submit to Absolute via fax or email a Service Guarantee Submission form, together with (A) OPoP of the stolen Customer Device (which confirms date of purchase, price, make, model and serial number); and (B) any additional information or documentation as may be reasonably requested by Absolute; and<br>(m)\tthe Customer Device must not have been flagged by Absolute as Recovered at the end of the Service Guarantee Period.<br>8.\tExcluded Losses. The Service Guarantee is not an insurance product. Absolute may, in its sole discretion, review your eligibility to receive Service Guarantee Payments if Absolute determines that your losses of Customer Devices, or Absolute’s payment of Service Guarantee Payments, are excessive or demonstrate a pattern of gross negligence or wilful misconduct in ensuring the security of your Customer Devices or otherwise render the provision of the Service unprofitable. Upon making such determination, Absolute will notify you and all outstanding losses will be Restricted Losses, and any subsequent losses will be deemed to be Restricted Losses until Absolute is satisfied, in its sole discretion, that you have implemented policies, procedures and other measures to address such gross negligence or wilful misconduct.<br>9.\tService Guarantee Payment. Always subject to the other provisions in this Agreement, then Absolute or an Authorized Third Party will pay to you the applicable “Service Guarantee Payment” to which you are entitled, if any, within thirty (30) days from the date you become entitled to a Service Guarantee Payment or if you have a consumer edition of the Service, within thirty (30) days from receipt of the duly completed Service Guarantee Submission form, submitted in accordance with the above terms.<br>10.\tService Guarantee Amount. The amount payable by Absolute or an Authorized Third Party as a Service Guarantee Payment will be based on the Theft Report Date in relation to the Service Term and subject to the other terms of this Agreement, will equal a percentage of the OPoP of the Customer Device up to a maximum amount, as follows:\t<br>For Customer Devices that are personal computers with either a corporate or consumer edition of the Service, the maximum amount will be:</p><p><br>Theft Report Date (based on year of Service Term)\tMaximum Amount<br>Percentage of OPoP\t$CAD\t$USD\t$AUD\t£GBP<br>Within the First Year\t90%\t1,000.00 1,000.00 1,000.00 800.00<br>During the Second Year\t80%\t800.00 800.00 800.00 640.00<br>During the Third Year\t60%\t600.00 600.00 600.00 480.00<br>During the Fourth Year\t40%\t400.00 400.00 400.00 320.00<br>During the Fifth Year\t20%\t200.00 200.00 200.00 160.00</p><p>For Customer Devices that are Android or Windows tablets/netbooks/smartphones with either a corporate or consumer edition of the Service, the maximum amount will be:</p><p>Theft Report Date (based on year of Service Term)\tMaximum Amount<br>Percentage of OPoP\t$CAD\t$USD\t$AUD\t£GBP<br>Within the First Year\t90%\t600.00 600.00 600.00 480.00<br>During the Second Year\t60%\t360.00 360.00 360.00 288.00<br>During the Third Year\t40%\t240.00 240.00 240.00 192.00<br>During the Fourth Year\t30%\t180.00 180.00 180.00 144.00<br>During the Fifth Year\t15%\t90.00 90.00 90.00 72.00</p><p>For Customer Devices that are iPads or iPad minis with either a corporate or consumer edition of the Service, the maximum amount will be:</p><p>Theft Report Date (based on year of Service Term)\tMaximum Amount<br>Percentage of OPoP\t$CAD\t$USD\t$AUD\t£GBP<br>Within the First Year\t90%\t450.00 450.00 450.00 360.00<br>During the Second Year\t80%\t360.00 360.00 360.00 288.00<br>During the Third Year\t60%\t270.00 270.00 270.00 216.00<br>During the Fourth Year\t40%\t180.00 180.00 180.00 140.00<br>During the Fifth Year\t20%\t90.00 90.00 90.00 70.00</p><p>For Customer Devices that are Chromebooks with a corporate or consumer edition of the Service, the maximum amount will be:</p><p>Theft Report Date (based on year of Service Term)\tMaximum Amount<br>Percentage of OPoP\t$CAD\t$USD\t$AUD\t£GBP<br>Within the First Year\t90%\t250.00\t250.00\t250.00\t200.00<br>During the Second Year\t60%\t150.00\t150.00\t150.00\t120.00<br>During the Third Year\t40%\t100.00\t100.00\t100.00\t80.00<br>During the Fourth Year\t30%\t75.00\t75.00\t75.00\t60.00<br>During the Fifth Year\t15%\t37.50\t37.50\t37.50\t30.00</p><p>11.\tOPoP Determination. <br>(a)\tIf you have a consumer edition of the Service and your Customer Device, the actual OPoP (as set out in your original proof of purchase receipt) will be used to calculate your Service Guarantee Payment. However, if you purchased a smartphone or tablet under a fixed term pricing or financing plan and the actual OPoP is not set out on your receipt or is less than US$220 or CAD$220 or AUD$220 or GBP£176 and, then your OPoP will be deemed to be US$220 or CAD$220 or AUD$220 or GBP£176. <br>(b)\tIf you have a corporate edition of the Service and your Customer Device is not an iPad, iPad mini or Chromebook, the following OPoP values will be deemed: for non-Android desktop computers, Macintosh computers and laptops, US$1,000 or CAD$1,000 or AUD$1,000 or GBP£800; for tablets and netbooks, US$450 or CAD$450 or AUD$450 or GBP£360; and for smartphones and mini-tablet devices, US$220 or CAD$220 or AUD$220 or GBP£176, unless in each case you provide us with an OPoP receipt within 30 days of the end of the applicable Service Guarantee Period, in which case the actual OPoP will be used for purposes of the calculation of the Service Guarantee Payment in accordance with Section 10 above. If you have a corporate edition of the Service and your Customer Device is an iPad or iPad mini, your OPoP will be deemed to be US$220 or CAD$220 or AUD$220 or GBP£176 for iPad mini devices; and, US$450 or CAD$450 or AUD$450 or GBP£360 for iPad® devices other than iPad mini® devices, unless in each case you provide us with an OPoP receipt within 30 days of the end of the applicable Service Guarantee Period, in which case the actual OPoP will be used for purposes of the calculation of the Service Guarantee Payment in accordance with Section 10 above. If you have a corporate edition of the Service and your Customer Device is a Chromebook, your OPoP will be deemed to be US$250 or CAD$250 or AUD$250 or GBP£200, unless you provide us with an OPoP receipt within 30 days of the end of the applicable Service Guarantee Period, in which case the actual OPoP will be used for purposes of the calculation of the Service Guarantee Payment in accordance with Section 10 above.<br>12.\tCurrency. The dollar amounts listed in the table above are paid out in United States Dollars if your region or country of residence is the United States, in Canadian Dollars if your region or country of residence is Canada, in Australian Dollars if your region or country of residence is Australia, and in British Sterling Pounds if your residence is in Britain. Absolute may in its sole discretion pay an equivalent amount in the currency of its choosing with respect to countries not listed in this paragraph.<br>13.\tPrepaid Service Guarantee Balance. If Absolute has paid a Service Guarantee Payment in respect of a Customer Device that is later recovered, or has a successful launch of a Locking Operation or Data Delete Operation (of any type) on the Customer Device in question, within 120 days for iPads, iPad minis or Chromebooks or within 60 days after the Service Guarantee Period for all other Customer Devices, Absolute may treat the amount of such Service Guarantee Payment as a prepaid Service Guarantee and deduct 100% of the amount of any prepaid Service Guarantee balance from any future Service Guarantee Payment payable by Absolute to you (whether or not, for greater certainty, for that particular Customer Device). You may find out your current prepaid Service Guarantee balance in Customer Center or Global Support.<br><br><br>APPENDIX “C”<br>PROFESSIONAL SERVICES<br>In addition to the Service, Absolute may agree to provide you Professional Services, as fixed packages of Professional Services available for purchase via an authorized Absolute reseller. The following terms and conditions will apply to any Professional Services pursuant to a fully executed Statement of Work, except as otherwise agreed by the parties in writing:<br>1.\tFees. You will pay to Absolute any related Professional Services fees within 30 days after the date of Absolute’s invoice, unless otherwise specified in the Statement of Work. Any other payment terms in the Statement of Work will also apply.<br>2.\tExpenses. You will reimburse Absolute for reasonable expenses incurred in performing the Professional Services, including travel and accommodation costs, long distance telecommunications costs, courier fees, reproduction costs, and other reasonable out-of-pocket costs. At your request, Absolute will give you copies of receipts or other customary expense documentation for expenses incurred.<br>3.\tOverdue Payments. Any overdue payment relating to Professional Services will bear interest at a rate of one and one-half percent (1-1/2%) per month, or nineteen and fifty-six one hundredths (19.56%) per annum, on the portion thereof that is overdue. If such interest rate is prohibited by Applicable Laws, the overdue payment shall bear interest at the highest interest rate permitted by Applicable Laws.<br>4.\tTaxes. Professional Services fees do not include any taxes, and you agree to pay any sales, use, value added or other taxes or import duties (other than Absolute’s corporate income taxes) based on or due as a result of any amounts paid to us under this Agreement. All fees will be paid in the currency of the country or region in which the Professional Services are being performed unless otherwise specified in a Statement of Work.<br>5.\tStart-Up Costs and Ramp-Down Costs. Unless otherwise set forth in a Statement of Work, if you stop or postpone the projects set forth in a Statement of Work you will pay for all Professional Services rendered up to the stop or postponement date and will pay for any start up costs associated with re-activating resources to complete the subject Statement of Work and any ramp-down costs associated with removing resources from the subject Statement of Work.<br>6.\tTools and Place of Work. You will provide all supplies, facilities, materials and other things which are required to perform the Professional Services, except for those things which Absolute is required to supply as set out in the Statement of Work. You will also provide us with any access to your premises, facilities and systems which we require to perform the Professional Services.<br>7.\tChanges. No changes will be made to the Professional Services, the Deliverables or the Statement of Work except by a written amendment signed by you and Absolute. Any changes to the Professional Services, the Deliverables or the Statement of Work may delay completion of the Professional Services and/or increase the related fees.<br>8.\tAcceptance. Unless otherwise specified in a Statement of Work,<br>(a)\tfollowing receipt of each Deliverable, you will have ten (10) days (the “Acceptance Period”) to perform acceptance testing of that Deliverable in accordance with the standards and procedures set out in the Statement of Work,<br>(b)\tif the Deliverable does not pass the acceptance test, you must give Absolute written notice rejecting the Deliverable within the Acceptance Period,<br>(c)\tif you do not give Absolute written notice rejecting any Deliverable by the end of the Acceptance Period, or if you deliver written notice accepting the Deliverable, such Deliverable will be deemed accepted on that date,<br>(d)\tif you give Absolute written notice rejecting any Deliverable within the Acceptance Period, then within 30 days after receipt of your notice, Absolute will make any reasonable corrections or changes and resubmit the Deliverable to you for further acceptance testing and you will cooperate with Absolute to isolate, identify and resolve any problems in the Deliverables,<br>(e)\tupon your receipt of the corrected Deliverable, the procedure outlined in this Section until the Deliverable is accepted, subject to the remaining provisions of this Section,<br>(f)\tif Absolute reasonably determines that the inability of any Deliverable to pass acceptance testing is due to System Problems and not to any material defect in that Deliverable, Absolute and you will jointly attempt to identify the source of the System Problems and possible workarounds or solutions and, in addition to the fees and expenses for the Professional Services, you will pay Absolute for any extra work related to the System Problems at its then-current hourly rates plus disbursements, taxes and all related costs and expenses, and<br>(g)\tnotwithstanding the foregoing, Deliverables in the nature of training services are deemed accepted upon delivery.<br>9.\tIntellectual Property. Unless otherwise set out in a Statement of Work,<br>(a)\tProfessional Services provided by Absolute to you under this Agreement are not performed on a “work for hire” basis and therefore any resulting work product (including Deliverables) will be considered Absolute Technology in which your only interest is a license to use the Deliverables in conjunction with the Service during an applicable Service Term,<br>(b)\tfor greater certainty, Absolute owns and retains all title to, ownership of, and all right, title and interest (including Intellectual Property Rights) in or to any Deliverable on the same basis as it does with respect to the Service and the Absolute Technology as described in Section 18. <br>(c)\tIf it is at any time determined that you own any right, title or interest (including any Intellectual Property Rights) in or to any Deliverable (other than the right to use it under the license granted by this Agreement), you will hold that right, title or interest in trust for Absolute and will, at our cost, transfer it to us at our request, and you will also waive any non-transferable Intellectual Property Rights such as moral rights.<br>10.\tRelationship. In providing any Professional Services and Deliverables, Absolute is acting as an independent contractor and not as your agent, partner, or joint venturer for any purpose; neither you nor we will have any right, power, or authority to act or to create any obligation, express or implied, on behalf of the other.<br>11.\tNon-Hire. You acknowledge that, in performing Professional Services, Absolute would be providing you with access to its Professional Services staff for a period of time, and that every member of such staff is a valuable resource to Absolute. Accordingly, you agree not to employ or solicit employment of any person who is Absolute’s employee or an employee of any of its Authorized Third Parties without our prior written consent, unless the person in question has ceased to be employed by Absolute or its Authorized Third Party for a period of 90 days.</p><p>12.\tProfessional Services Disclaimer.
