It is a legal document that \r\nexplains your rights and obligations related to your use of the Unreal® \r\nEngine and related content.  By downloading or using this software or \r\nany related content, you are agreeing to be bound by the terms of this \r\nAgreement.  If you do not or cannot agree to the terms of this \r\nAgreement, please do not download or use this software or any related \r\ncontent. \r\n\t</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\tCertain words or phrases are defined to have certain meanings when \r\nused in this Agreement.  Those words and phrases are defined below in \r\nSection 24.\r\n\t</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\tIf your primary residence (or primary place of business, if you are a \r\nlegal entity like a corporation or an academic institution) is in the \r\nUnited States of America, your agreement is with Epic Games, Inc.  If it\r\n is not in the United States of America, your agreement is with Epic \r\nGames International S.à r.l., acting through its Swiss branch. \r\n\t</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\tIf you are separately licensed by Epic under a Custom License, certain\r\n terms of this Agreement do not apply to your Custom Products.  Those \r\nterms are described below in Section 25.\r\n\t</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t<strong>1. License Grant </strong>\r\n\t</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\tEpic grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable \r\n(except as described in this Agreement) license for a single User to \r\nuse, reproduce, display, perform, and modify the Licensed Technology for\r\n any lawful purpose (the “<strong>License</strong>”).  However, the \r\nrights that Epic grants you under the License are subject to the terms \r\nof this Agreement, and you may only make use of the License if you \r\ncomply with all applicable terms.\r\n\t</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\tThe License becomes effective on the date you accept this Agreement or\r\n download the Engine Code or any Content.  The License does not grant \r\nyou any title or ownership in the Licensed Technology. \r\n\t</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t<strong><em>Allowed forms of Distribution and Sublicensing</em></strong>\r\n\t</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\tYou may only Distribute the Licensed Technology as follows:\r\n\t</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\ta.  <u>Distribution to end users</u> - You may Distribute the \r\nLicensed Technology incorporated in object code format only as an \r\ninseparable part of a Product to end users who are subject to an end \r\nuser license agreement which explicitly disclaims any representations, \r\nwarranties, conditions, and liabilities related to the Licensed \r\nTechnology.  The Product may not contain any Engine Tools or any \r\nMarketplace Content Distributed in uncooked source format.\r\n\t</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\tb.  <u>Distribution to other licensees</u> - You may Distribute \r\nEngine Code (including as modified by you under the License) in Source \r\nCode or object code format, or any Content, to an Engine Licensee who \r\nhas rights under its license to the same Version of the Engine Code or \r\nContent that you are Distributing.  \r\n\t</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\tAny public Distribution (i.e., intended for Engine Licensees \r\ngenerally) which includes Engine Tools must take place either through \r\nthe Marketplace (<em>e.g.</em>, for distributing a Product’s modding tool or editor to end users) or through a fork of Epic’s GitHub UnrealEngine Network (<em>e.g.</em>, for distributing source code).<br>\r\n\t\t<br>\r\n\t\tYou also may Distribute Content to an Engine Licensee who is your \r\nemployee or your contractor regardless of whether they have rights under\r\n their license to the same Content, but only to permit that Engine \r\nLicensee to utilize that Content in good faith to develop a Product on \r\nyour behalf for Distribution by you under the License, and not for the \r\npurpose of Content pooling or any other Distribution or sublicensing of \r\nContent that is not permitted under this Agreement.  Recipients of such a\r\n Distribution have a limited license to use, reproduce, display, \r\nperform, and modify that Content to develop your Product as outlined \r\nabove, and for no other purpose.\r\n\t</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\tc.  <u>Distribution and sublicensing of Examples</u> - You may \r\nDistribute or sublicense Examples (including as modified by you under \r\nthe License) in Source Code or object code format to any third party.  \r\nHowever, the rights in this Section 1(c) do not expand or modify your \r\nlimited Distribution and sublicensing rights for Engine Code and Content\r\n (including as modified by you under the License) that are not Examples.\r\n\t</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\td.  <u>Distribution of Non-C++ Programming Language Integration</u> -\r\n You may Distribute an integration of a programming language other than \r\nC++ for the Licensed Technology, but if you do, the integration must be \r\nDistributed free of charge, permit Distribution in a Product free of \r\ncharge on all platforms, and be available in source code form \r\n(including, but not limited to, any compiler, linker, toolchain, or \r\nruntime) to all Engine Licensees.\r\n\t</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\tYou are permitted to post snippets of Engine Code, up to 30 lines of \r\ncode in length, online in public forums for the sole purpose of \r\ndiscussing the content of the snippet and not for the purpose of \r\nenabling non-Engine Licensees to use or modify any Engine Code, or to \r\naggregate, recombine, or reconstruct any larger portion of the Engine \r\nCode.\r\n\t</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\tYou may not sublicense the Licensed Technology in Source Code format. \r\n You may not sublicense the Licensed Technology in object code format, \r\nor any Content, except to grant end users the ability to use, or to \r\npermit your publishers and distributors to market and Distribute, a \r\nProduct that you Distribute as permitted in Section 1(a) above.  This \r\nparagraph does not limit your rights to Distribute and sublicense \r\nExamples.\r\n\t</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\tWhen you generate revenue from a Product or Distribute it to end users, you must provide Epic with advance notification at <a href=\"https://www.unrealengine.com/release\">unrealengine.com/release</a>,\r\n as early as reasonably possible, including the name of the Product, the\r\n format of distribution, unique Product id (where applicable), and the \r\ndistribution channel(s).\r\n\t</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t<strong><em>Other Restrictions</em></strong>\r\n\t</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t<em>UE-Only Content</em>\r\n\t</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\tFor UE-Only Content, you may exercise your rights under the License \r\nonly if and to the extent that the UE-Only Content is utilized in \r\ncombination with the Engine Code.  For example, you may not develop or \r\nDistribute a Product that consists of or contains UE-Only Content but \r\ndoes not contain and require the Engine Code (including as modified by \r\nyou under the License) for its use.  The UE-Only Content will be subject\r\n to all of the terms of this Agreement that apply to Content, as well as\r\n the additional limitations described in this paragraph.  All references\r\n in this paragraph to UE-Only Content include modified versions thereof \r\nmade by you under the License.\r\n\t</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t<em>Non-Compatible Licenses</em>\r\n\t</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\tYou may not combine, Distribute, or otherwise use the Licensed \r\nTechnology with any code or other content which is covered by a license \r\nthat would directly or indirectly require that all or part of the \r\nLicensed Technology be governed under any terms other than those of this\r\n Agreement (“<strong>Non-Compatible License</strong>”).  Code or content\r\n under the following licenses, for example, are prohibited:  GNU General\r\n Public License (GPL), Lesser GPL (LGPL) (unless you are merely \r\ndynamically linking a shared library), or Creative Commons \r\nAttribution-ShareAlike License.  Code or content under the following \r\nlicenses, for example, are allowed:  BSD License, MIT License, Microsoft\r\n Public License, or Apache License.  You may not sublicense the Licensed\r\n Technology under a Non-Compatible License.\r\n\t</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t<em>General Restrictions</em>\r\n\t</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\tYou may not engage in any activity with respect to the Licensed \r\nTechnology, including as incorporated into a Product, (1) for any \r\ngambling-related activities or Products (as defined by law in the \r\njurisdiction of use); (2) for operation of nuclear facilities, aircraft \r\nnavigation, aircraft communication systems or air traffic control \r\nmachines, or for military use in connection with live combat; (3) in \r\nviolation of any applicable law or regulation; (4) in which the Licensed\r\n Technology is rented or leased; (5) that misappropriates any of Epic’s \r\nother products or services; (6) in support of a claim by you or any \r\nthird party that the Licensed Technology infringes a patent.  You also \r\nmay not sell or grant a security interest in the Licensed Technology.\r\n\t</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t<strong><em>Limited License for Unreal Tournament Content</em></strong>\r\n\t</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\tEpic grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable \r\nlicense, during the Unreal Tournament Project, for a single User to use,\r\n reproduce, and modify the Unreal Tournament Content for the sole \r\npurposes of creating Unreal Tournament Contributions for the Unreal \r\nTournament Project and creating Unreal Tournament UGC (the “<strong>Unreal Tournament License</strong>”). \r\n You may not Distribute or sublicense to any person other than Epic, or \r\ninclude in any product, any Unreal Tournament Content.  The Unreal \r\nTournament License does not grant you any title, ownership rights, or \r\nother intellectual property rights in any Unreal Tournament Content.  \r\nYou agree to retain and reproduce in all copies of the Unreal Tournament\r\n Content the copyright, trademark, and other proprietary notices and \r\ndisclaimers of Epic as they appear in the Unreal Tournament Content.  \r\nUpon the completion of the Unreal Tournament Project or termination of \r\nthe Epic Licenses under Section 16, or upon earlier written notice from \r\nEpic if you materially breach the terms of the Unreal Tournament \r\nLicense, you must destroy all copies of the Unreal Tournament Content.  \r\nAll references in this paragraph to the Unreal Tournament Content \r\ninclude modified versions thereof made by you under the Unreal \r\nTournament License.\r\n\t</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\tAny Distribution of Unreal Tournament UGC must take place through the \r\nMarketplace, Epic’s GitHub UnrealEngine Network, or other Epic services,\r\n unless such Distribution is solely for the purpose of legitimate \r\ndevelopment of such Unreal Tournament UGC, and then only to Engine \r\nLicensees, or legitimate testing of such Unreal Tournament UGC, and then\r\n only to Engine Licensees or individuals who have accepted the latest \r\nUnreal Tournament EULA.\r\n\t</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t<strong>2. User License</strong>\r\n\t</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\tThe Licensed Technology is licensed to you for use by a single User.  \r\nThe User may store the Licensed Technology on any of the User’s \r\ncomputers, but the Licensed Technology cannot be shared with others \r\n(including any other employees or agents) except through a permitted \r\nDistribution as described above. \r\n\t</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\tIn order to access and download the Engine Code and Content, you must \r\nset up an Account.  You may not share or allow others to use your \r\nAccount.  You are responsible for the security of your Account.  For \r\nquestions regarding your Account, please go to unrealengine.com/contact.\r\n\t</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\tUnder the License, the User may use the Licensed Technology for as \r\nlong as you comply with this Agreement.  If you are a legal entity, \r\nreferences to “you” in this agreement also apply to the User in all \r\ncases.  You are responsible for the User’s compliance with this \r\nAgreement. \r\n\t</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\tIf you are an Academic Institution, the limitation to use by a single \r\nUser does not apply with respect to the Licensed Technology.  Instead, \r\nyou may store the Licensed Technology on any of your computers, and you \r\nmay allow all users of those computers to use the Licensed Technology \r\n(excluding any Marketplace Content) under the License.  However, those \r\nusers are not authorized under your License to Distribute or sublicense \r\nthe Licensed Technology (including as incorporated in a Product) unless \r\nthey obtain a License of their own.\r\n\t</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t<strong>3.  New Versions and Content</strong>\r\n\t</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\tDuring the term of your License, you will be entitled to access future\r\n Versions of the Engine Code and new Content that Epic chooses to make \r\navailable to you.  Epic does not have any obligation to make new \r\nVersions of the Engine Code or new Content available.  Nor does Epic \r\nhave any obligation to continue to make available for access or download\r\n any or all Versions of the Engine Code or Content.  However, any \r\nVersions of the Engine Code and Content that Epic has made available to \r\nyou, and for which you have accepted any applicable amendment to this \r\nAgreement as described in Section 21, are considered part of the \r\nLicensed Technology and may be used under the License (as amended by \r\nthat amendment).\r\n\t</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\tEpic may also make Marketplace Content available to you for a fee.  \r\nYour License to Marketplace Content is subject to your payment of the \r\nassociated fee.  When you pay the fee to obtain that Marketplace \r\nContent, you are purchasing from Epic the right to have your License \r\ninclude that Marketplace Content.  Regardless of any references Epic may\r\n make outside this Agreement to purchasing or selling Marketplace \r\nContent, Marketplace Content is licensed, not sold, to you under the \r\nLicense. \r\n\t</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\tWhen you provide payment information to Epic or its authorized \r\nprocessor, you represent that you are an authorized user of the payment \r\ncard, PIN, key, account, or other payment method specified by you, and \r\nyou authorize Epic to charge such payment method for the full amount of \r\nthe transaction.\r\n\t</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t<strong>4.  Royalty </strong>\r\n\t</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\tYou agree to pay Epic a royalty equal to 5% of all worldwide gross \r\nrevenue actually attributable to each Product, regardless of whether \r\nthat revenue is received by you or any other person or legal entity, as \r\nfollows:\r\n\t</p>\r\n\r\n\t<ol><li>\r\n\t\t\tGross revenue resulting from any and all sales of a Product to end \r\nusers through any and all media, including but not limited to digital \r\nand retail;\r\n\t\t</li><li>\r\n\t\t\tGross revenue resulting from any and all in-app purchases, \r\ndownloadable content, microtransactions, subscriptions, sale, transfer, \r\nor exchange of content created by end users for use with a Product, or \r\nredemption of virtual currency, either within a Product or made \r\nexternally but which directly affect the operation of the Product;\r\n\t\t</li><li>\r\n\t\t\tGross revenue from any Kickstarter or other crowdfunding campaign \r\nwhich is directly associated with Product access or in-Product benefit (<em>e.g.</em>,\r\n in a multi-tiered campaign, if an amount is established in an early \r\ntier solely for Product access, your royalty obligation will apply to \r\nthat amount for each backer with the same access, but not on additional \r\namounts in higher tiers based on ancillary benefits);\r\n\t\t</li><li>\r\n\t\t\tYour revenue from in-app advertising and affiliate programs;\r\n\t\t</li><li>\r\n\t\t\tRevenue from advance payments for a Product (from a publisher or otherwise); and\r\n\t\t</li><li>\r\n\t\t\tRevenue in any other form actually attributable to a Product (unless excluded below).\r\n\t\t</li></ol>\r\n\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\tHowever, no royalty is owed on the following forms of revenue:\r\n\t</p>\r\n\r\n\t<ol><li>\r\n\t\t\tThe first $3,000.00 in gross revenue for each Product per calendar quarter;\r\n\t\t</li><li>\r\n\t\t\tConsulting fees or work-for-hire fees which are non-recoupable for services performed using the Licensed Technology (<em>e.g.</em>, an architect-created walkthrough simulation or a contractor-developed in-house training simulator);\r\n\t\t</li><li>\r\n\t\t\tRevenue from a Product which solely relies on the Licensed Technology for production of non-interactive linear media (<em>.e.g.</em>,\r\n broadcast or streamed video files, cartoons, or movies) and which is \r\nDistributed in a form that does not contain the Licensed Technology or, \r\nin order to deliver, rely on servers running the Licensed Technology;\r\n\t\t</li><li>\r\n\t\t\tRevenue from a Product which is only Distributed to Engine Licensees (such as through the Marketplace);\r\n\t\t</li><li>\r\n\t\t\tRevenue from ancillary products which are not software and which do \r\nnot contain embedded information (such as QR codes) which affects the \r\noperation of the Product (<em>e.g.</em>, comic books, soundtracks, apparel);\r\n\t\t</li><li>\r\n\t\t\tFinancial winnings generated by awards for the Product;\r\n\t\t</li><li>\r\n\t\t\tRevenue from donations for a Product which are not tied to Product access or in-Product benefits; and\r\n\t\t</li><li>\r\n\t\t\tRevenue from interactive amusement park rides or coin-operated arcade games which use the Licensed Technology.\r\n\t\t</li></ol>\r\n\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\tThe royalty is based on gross revenue from end users, regardless of \r\nwhether you sell your Product to end users directly, self-publish via \r\nthe App Store or any similar store, or work with a publisher.  The \r\nfollowing simplified example illustrates the application of the royalty \r\nto gross sales:  if your Product earns $10 on the App Store, Apple may \r\npay you $7 (having deducted 30% as a distribution fee), but your royalty\r\n to Epic would still be 5% of $10 (or $0.50).\r\n\t</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\tRoyalties that you pay on an advance payment of revenue for a Product \r\nthat is recoupable by the payer, such as a publisher, may be credited \r\nagainst future royalty payments that you incur under this Agreement for \r\nthat Product.\r\n\t</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\tWithin 45 days after the end of each calendar quarter in which a \r\nProduct earns revenue outside of the above-listed royalty exclusions, \r\nyou must pay to Epic the full amount of the royalty due for that quarter\r\n and send Epic a royalty report on a per Product basis.  Detailed \r\ninformation on royalty reporting and payment can be found at <a href=\"https://www.unrealengine.com/release\">unrealengine.com/release</a>.\r\n\t</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\tThe royalty will be payable under this Agreement with respect to each \r\nProduct for as long as any Engine Code or Assets (including as modified \r\nby you under the License) incorporated in or used to make the Product \r\nare protected under copyright or other applicable intellectual property \r\nlaw.\r\n\t</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t<strong>5.  Payments</strong>\r\n\t</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\tEpic reserves the right to charge a 2% late fee, per calendar quarter \r\n(compounding), for any amounts unpaid after the required due date.\r\n\t</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\tYou are responsible for all taxes on all payments required to be made \r\nby you under this Agreement (other than taxes that Epic is obligated to \r\npay on its income, which are Epic’s responsibility).  If you are \r\nrequired by a government agency to reduce your payment to Epic for any \r\nreason, you are required to provide sufficient documentation to Epic \r\nsupporting the withholding.  For questions about withholding taxes or \r\ntaxes in general, please go to <a href=\"https://www.unrealengine.com/contact\">unrealengine.com/contact</a>.\r\n\t</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t<strong>6.  Records and Audits  </strong>\r\n\t</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\tYou agree to keep accurate books and records related to your \r\ndevelopment, manufacture, Distribution, and sale of Products and related\r\n revenue.  Epic may conduct reasonable audits of those books and \r\nrecords.  Audits will be conducted during business hours on reasonable \r\nprior notice to you.  Epic will bear the costs of audits unless the \r\nresults show a shortfall in payments in excess of 5% during the period \r\naudited, in which case you will be responsible for the cost of the \r\naudit.\r\n\t</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t<strong>7.  Support  </strong>\r\n\t</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\tEpic does not have any support obligations with respect to the \r\nLicensed Technology under this Agreement.  Support resources may be \r\nobtained at <a href=\"https://www.unrealengine.com/faq\">unrealengine.com/faq</a>.\r\n\t</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t<strong>8.  Feedback and Contributions  </strong>\r\n\t</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\tIf you provide Epic with any Feedback, Epic is free to use the \r\nFeedback however it chooses.  If you make any Contribution available to \r\nEpic, you hereby assign to Epic all right, title, and interest \r\n(including all copyright, patent, and other intellectual property \r\nrights) in that Contribution for all current and future methods and \r\nforms of exploitation in any country.  If any of those rights are not \r\neffectively assigned under applicable law, you hereby grant Epic a \r\nnon-exclusive, fully-paid, irrevocable, transferable, sublicensable \r\nlicense to reproduce, distribute, publicly perform, publicly display, \r\nmake, use, have made, sell, offer to sell, import, modify and make \r\nderivative works based on, and otherwise exploit that Contribution for \r\nall current and future methods and forms of exploitation in any \r\ncountry.  If any of those rights may not be assigned or licensed under \r\napplicable law (such as moral and other personal rights), you hereby \r\nwaive and agree not to assert all of those rights.  However, you may \r\ncontinue to freely use any Feedback that you provide to Epic, and you \r\nmay continue to use, in any manner consistent with the License, any \r\nContribution (including Unreal Tournament Code Contributions) that you \r\nmake available to Epic.  For Unreal Tournament Content Contributions, \r\nyou may continue to use those Contributions only in a manner consistent \r\nwith the Unreal Tournament License.\r\n\t</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\tYou understand and agree that Epic is not required to make any use of \r\nany Feedback or Contribution that you provide.  You agree that if Epic \r\nmakes use of your Feedback or Contribution, Epic is not required to \r\ncredit or compensate you for your contribution.\r\n\t</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\tYou represent and warrant that you have sufficient rights in any \r\nFeedback or Contribution that you provide to Epic to grant Epic and \r\nother affected parties the rights described above.  This includes but is\r\n not limited to intellectual property rights and other proprietary or \r\npersonal rights.\r\n\t</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t<strong>9.  Third Party Software  </strong>\r\n\t</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\tThe Engine Code includes Third Party Software components.  If Third \r\nParty Software has separate software license or attribution \r\nrequirements, the license terms or other attribution requirements for \r\nThird Party Software components can be found in the installation \r\ndirectory for each engine version (under the \r\n/Engine/Source/ThirdParty/Licenses sub-folder).  By entering into this \r\nAgreement and using Third Party Software, you are accepting the terms of\r\n those licenses.

For Custom Products, the terms of your applicable Custom \r\nLicense will govern all matters (including royalties, notifications, \r\nFeedback, Contributions, trademarks, service marks, trade names, logos, \r\nscreen shots, and video content related to those Custom Products) \r\nrelated to your use of the code, artwork, and content that are licensed \r\nto you under that Custom License, instead of the terms of this \r\nAgreement. \r\n\t</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\tYou may exercise your rights in Marketplace Content under this License\r\n in connection with Custom Products that are developed and Distributed \r\nunder your Custom License as if they were Products developed and \r\nDistributed under the License.  However, your exercise of those rights \r\nin connection with Custom Products is governed by and subject to the \r\nterms of this Agreement, including without limitation all obligations \r\nand limitations that apply to use of Marketplace Content in connection \r\nwith Products, as well as all disclaimers, limitations of liability, and\r\n indemnification rights of Epic, whether related to Marketplace Content,\r\n Products, or otherwise.  Despite this, no royalty is owed under this \r\nAgreement on Custom Products, but royalties may be owed on Custom \r\nProducts under the terms of a Custom License.\r\n\t</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\tAs used in this Agreement, the defined term “Product” does not include\r\n Custom Products, and except as described above, the terms of this \r\nAgreement applicable to Products do not apply to Custom Products.\r\n\t</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t<strong>26. Miscellaneous</strong>\r\n\t</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\tThis Agreement and any document or information referred to in this \r\nAgreement constitute the entire agreement between you and Epic relating \r\nto the subject matter covered by this Agreement.  All other \r\ncommunications, proposals, and representations with respect to the \r\nsubject matter covered by this Agreement are excluded. \r\n\t</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\tThe original of this Agreement is in English; any translations are \r\nprovided for reference purposes only.  You waive any right you may have \r\nunder the law of your country to have this Agreement written or \r\nconstrued in the language of any other country.\r\n\t</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\tThis Agreement describes certain legal rights. You may have other \r\nrights under the laws of your jurisdiction. This Agreement does not \r\nchange your rights under the laws of your jurisdiction if the laws of \r\nyour jurisdiction do not permit it to do so. Limitations and exclusions \r\nof warranties and remedies in this Agreement may not apply to you \r\nbecause your jurisdiction may not allow them in your particular \r\ncircumstance.  In the event that certain provisions of this Agreement \r\nare not enforceable in your jurisdiction, those provisions shall be \r\nenforceable to the furthest extent possible under applicable law.\r\n\t</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\tAny act by Epic to exercise, or failure or delay in exercise of, any \r\nof its rights under this Agreement, at law or in equity will not be \r\ndeemed a waiver of those or any other rights or remedies available in \r\ncontract, at law or in equity.\r\n\t</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\tUnless otherwise stated in this Agreement, if any term of this \r\nAgreement is held by a court or tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be\r\n unenforceable, the term will be enforced to the maximum extent \r\npermissible and the remaining terms of this Agreement will remain in \r\nfull force and effect.  You agree that this Agreement does not confer \r\nany rights or remedies on any person other than the parties to this \r\nAgreement, except as expressly stated.\r\n\t</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\tEpic’s obligations are subject to existing laws and legal process, and\r\n Epic may comply with law enforcement or regulatory requests or \r\nrequirements despite any contrary term in this Agreement.</p></section>"
