This occurred <br>any time an entity did not release their application to a \"third party\".</p><p>While there is a certain freedom in this model of licensing, it struck the <br>authors of the RPL as being unfair to the open source community at large and to <br>the original authors of the works in particular. After all, bug fixes, <br>extensions, and meaningful and valuable derivatives were not consistently <br>finding their way back into the community where they could fuel further, and <br>faster, growth and expansion of the overall open source software base.</p><p>While you should clearly read and understand the entire license, the essence of <br>the RPL is found in two definitions: \"Deploy\" and \"Required Components\".</p><p>Regarding deployment, under the RPL your changes, bug fixes, extensions, etc. <br>must be made available to the open source community at large when you Deploy in <br>any form -- either internally or to an outside party. Once you start running <br>the software you have to start sharing the software.</p><p>Further, under the RPL all components you author including schemas, scripts, <br>source code, etc. -- regardless of whether they're compiled into a single <br>binary or used as two halves of client/server application -- must be shared. <br>You have to share the whole pie, not an isolated slice of it.</p><p>In addition to these goals, the RPL was authored to meet the requirements of <br>the Open Source Definition as maintained by the Open Source Initiative (OSI).</p><p>The specific terms and conditions of the license are defined in the remainder <br>of this document.</p><p>LICENSE TERMS</p><p>1.0 General; Applicability & Definitions. This Reciprocal Public License <br>Version 1.5 (\"License\") applies to any programs or other works as well as any <br>and all updates or maintenance releases of said programs or works (\"Software\") <br>not already covered by this License which the Software copyright holder <br>(\"Licensor\") makes available containing a License Notice (hereinafter defined) <br>from the Licensor specifying or allowing use or distribution under the terms of <br>this License.

By application of the provisions in <br>Section 6 below, each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty- <br>free, non-exclusive license, subject to said Contributor's intellectual <br>property rights, and any third party intellectual property claims derived from <br>the Licensed Software under this License, to do the following:</p><p>4.1 Use, reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute any <br>Extensions Deployed by such Contributor or portions thereof, in both Source <br>Code form or as an executable program, either on an unmodified basis or as <br>part of Derivative Works.</p><p>4.2 Under claims of patents now or hereafter owned or controlled by <br>Contributor, to make, use, have made, and/or otherwise dispose of Extensions <br>or portions thereof, but solely to the extent that any such claim is necessary <br>to enable You to make, use, have made, and/or otherwise dispose of <br>Licensed Software or portions thereof.</p><p>5.0 Exclusions From License Grant. Nothing in this License shall be deemed to <br>grant any rights to trademarks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets or any <br>other intellectual property of Licensor or any Contributor except as expressly <br>stated herein. Except as expressly stated in Sections 3 and 4, no other patent <br>rights, express or implied, are granted herein. Your Extensions may require <br>additional patent licenses from Licensor or Contributors which each may grant <br>in its sole discretion. No right is granted to the trademarks of Licensor or <br>any Contributor even if such marks are included in the Licensed Software. <br>Nothing in this License shall be interpreted to prohibit Licensor from <br>licensing under different terms from this License any code that Licensor <br>otherwise would have a right to license.</p><p>5.1 You expressly acknowledge and agree that although Licensor and each <br>Contributor grants the licenses to their respective portions of the Licensed <br>Software set forth herein, no assurances are provided by Licensor or any <br>Contributor that the Licensed Software does not infringe the patent or other <br>intellectual property rights of any other entity. Licensor and each <br>Contributor disclaim any liability to You for claims brought by any other <br>entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As <br>a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, You <br>hereby assume sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property <br>rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is <br>required to allow You to distribute the Licensed Software, it is Your <br>responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Licensed <br>Software.</p><p>6.0 Your Obligations And Grants. In consideration of, and as an express <br>condition to, the licenses granted to You under this License You hereby agree <br>that any Modifications, Derivative Works, or Required Components (collectively <br>Extensions) that You create or to which You contribute are governed by the <br>terms of this License including, without limitation, Section 4. Any Extensions <br>that You create or to which You contribute must be Deployed under the terms of <br>this License or a future version of this License released under Section 7. You <br>hereby grant to Licensor and all third parties a world-wide, non-exclusive, <br>royalty-free license under those intellectual property rights You own or <br>control to use, reproduce, display, perform, modify, create derivatives, <br>sublicense, and distribute Licensed Software, in any form. Any Extensions You <br>make and Deploy must have a distinct title so as to readily tell any <br>subsequent user or Contributor that the Extensions are by You. You must <br>include a copy of this License or directions on how to obtain a copy with <br>every copy of the Extensions You distribute. You agree not to offer or impose <br>any terms on any Source Code or executable version of the Licensed Software, <br>or its Extensions that alter or restrict the applicable version of this <br>License or the recipients' rights hereunder.</p><p>6.1 Availability of Source Code. You must make available, under the terms of <br>this License, the Source Code of any Extensions that You Deploy, via an <br>Electronic Distribution Mechanism. The Source Code for any version that You <br>Deploy must be made available within one (1) month of when you Deploy and must <br>remain available for no less than twelve (12) months after the date You cease <br>to Deploy. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code to each <br>version You Deploy remains available even if the Electronic Distribution <br>Mechanism is maintained by a third party. You may not charge a fee for any <br>copy of the Source Code distributed under this Section in excess of Your <br>actual cost of duplication and distribution of said copy.</p><p>6.2 Description of Modifications. You must cause any Modifications that You <br>create or to which You contribute to be documented in the Source Code, clearly <br>describing the additions, changes or deletions You made. You must include a <br>prominent statement that the Modifications are derived, directly or indirectly, <br>from the Licensed Software and include the names of the Licensor and any <br>Contributor to the Licensed Software in (i) the Source Code and (ii) in any <br>notice displayed by the Licensed Software You distribute or in related <br>documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership of the Licensed <br>Software. You may not modify or delete any pre-existing copyright notices, <br>change notices or License text in the Licensed Software without written <br>permission of the respective Licensor or Contributor.</p><p>6.3 Intellectual Property Matters.</p><p>a. Third Party Claims. If You have knowledge that a license to a third party's <br>intellectual property right is required to exercise the rights granted by this <br>License, You must include a human-readable file with Your distribution that <br>describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a <br>recipient will know whom to contact.</p><p>b. Contributor APIs. If Your Extensions include an application programming <br>interface (\"API\") and You have knowledge of patent licenses that are <br>reasonably necessary to implement that API, You must also include this <br>information in a human-readable file supplied with Your distribution.</p><p>c. Representations. You represent that, except as disclosed pursuant to 6.3(a) <br>above, You believe that any Extensions You distribute are Your original <br>creations and that You have sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by <br>this License.</p><p>6.4 Required Notices.</p><p>a. License Text. You must duplicate this License or instructions on how to <br>acquire a copy in any documentation You provide along with the Source Code of <br>any Extensions You create or to which You contribute, wherever You describe <br>recipients' rights relating to Licensed Software.</p><p>b. License Notice. You must duplicate any notice contained in EXHIBIT A (the <br>\"License Notice\") in each file of the Source Code of any copy You distribute <br>of the Licensed Software and Your Extensions. If You create an Extension, You <br>may add Your name as a Contributor to the Source Code and accompanying <br>documentation along with a description of the contribution. If it is not <br>possible to put the License Notice in a particular Source Code file due to its <br>structure, then You must include such License Notice in a location where a <br>user would be likely to look for such a notice.</p><p>c. Source Code Availability. You must notify the software community of the <br>availability of Source Code to Your Extensions within one (1) month of the date <br>You initially Deploy and include in such notification a description of the <br>Extensions, and instructions on how to acquire the Source Code. Should such <br>instructions change you must notify the software community of revised <br>instructions within one (1) month of the date of change. You must provide <br>notification by posting to appropriate news groups, mailing lists, weblogs, or <br>other sites where a publicly accessible search engine would reasonably be <br>expected to index your post in relationship to queries regarding the Licensed <br>Software and/or Your Extensions.</p><p>d. User-Visible Attribution. You must duplicate any notice contained in <br>EXHIBIT B (the \"User-Visible Attribution Notice\") in each user-visible display <br>of the Licensed Software and Your Extensions which delineates copyright, <br>ownership, or similar attribution information. If You create an Extension, <br>You may add Your name as a Contributor, and add Your attribution notice, as an <br>equally visible and functional element of any User-Visible Attribution Notice <br>content. To ensure proper attribution, You must also include such User-Visible <br>Attribution Notice in at least one location in the Software documentation <br>where a user would be likely to look for such notice.</p><p>6.5 Additional Terms. You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, warranty, <br>support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of <br>Licensed Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on <br>behalf of the Licensor or any Contributor except as permitted under other <br>agreements between you and Licensor or Contributor. You must make it clear that <br>any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You <br>alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Licensor and every Contributor for <br>any liability plus attorney fees, costs, and related expenses due to any such <br>action or claim incurred by the Licensor or such Contributor as a result of <br>warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.</p><p>6.6 Conflicts With Other Licenses. Where any portion of Your Extensions, by <br>virtue of being Derivative Works of another product or similar circumstance, <br>fall under the terms of another license, the terms of that license should be <br>honored however You must also make Your Extensions available under this <br>License. If the terms of this License continue to conflict with the terms of <br>the other license you may write the Licensor for permission to resolve the <br>conflict in a fashion that remains consistent with the intent of this License. <br>Such permission will be granted at the sole discretion of the Licensor.</p><p>7.0 Versions of This License. Licensor may publish from time to time revised <br>versions of the License. Once Licensed Software has been published under a <br>particular version of the License, You may always continue to use it under the <br>terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Licensed Software under <br>the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by Licensor. No <br>one other than Licensor has the right to modify the terms applicable to <br>Licensed Software created under this License.</p><p>7.1 If You create or use a modified version of this License, which You may do <br>only in order to apply it to software that is not already Licensed Software <br>under this License, You must rename Your license so that it is not confusingly <br>similar to this License, and must make it clear that Your license contains <br>terms that differ from this License. In so naming Your license, You may not <br>use any trademark of Licensor or of any Contributor. Should Your modifications <br>to this License be limited to alteration of a) Section 13.8 solely to modify <br>the legal Jurisdiction or Venue for disputes, b) EXHIBIT A solely to define <br>License Notice text, or c) to EXHIBIT B solely to define a User-Visible <br>Attribution Notice, You may continue to refer to Your License as the <br>Reciprocal Public License or simply the RPL.</p><p>8.0 Disclaimer of Warranty. LICENSED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE <br>ON AN \"AS IS\" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, <br>INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE LICENSED SOFTWARE IS FREE <br>OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. <br>FURTHER THERE IS NO WARRANTY MADE AND ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES ARE DISCLAIMED <br>THAT THE LICENSED SOFTWARE MEETS OR COMPLIES WITH ANY DESCRIPTION OF <br>PERFORMANCE OR OPERATION, SAID COMPATIBILITY AND SUITABILITY BEING YOUR <br>RESPONSIBILITY.

SHOULD LICENSED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY <br>RESPECT, YOU (AND NOT THE LICENSOR OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST <br>OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS <br>LICENSOR WILL NOT SUPPORT THIS SOFTWARE AND IS UNDER NO OBLIGATION TO ISSUE <br>UPDATES TO THIS SOFTWARE. LICENSOR HAS NO KNOWLEDGE OF ERRANT CODE OR VIRUS IN <br>THIS SOFTWARE, BUT DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE SOFTWARE IS FREE FROM SUCH ERRORS <br>OR VIRUSES. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS <br>LICENSE. NO USE OF LICENSED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS <br>DISCLAIMER.</p><p>9.0 Limitation of Liability. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, <br>WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL THE <br>LICENSOR, ANY CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF LICENSED SOFTWARE, OR ANY <br>SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, <br>SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, <br>WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER <br>FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, <br>EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH <br>DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH <br>OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT <br>APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE <br>EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS <br>EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p><p>10.0 High Risk Activities. THE LICENSED SOFTWARE IS NOT FAULT-TOLERANT AND IS <br>NOT DESIGNED, MANUFACTURED, OR INTENDED FOR USE OR DISTRIBUTION AS ON-LINE <br>CONTROL EQUIPMENT IN HAZARDOUS ENVIRONMENTS REQUIRING FAIL-SAFE PERFORMANCE, <br>SUCH AS IN THE OPERATION OF NUCLEAR FACILITIES, AIRCRAFT NAVIGATION OR <br>COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS, AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL, DIRECT LIFE SUPPORT MACHINES, OR <br>WEAPONS SYSTEMS, IN WHICH THE FAILURE OF THE LICENSED SOFTWARE COULD LEAD <br>DIRECTLY TO DEATH, PERSONAL INJURY, OR SEVERE PHYSICAL OR ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE <br>(\"HIGH RISK ACTIVITIES\"). LICENSOR AND CONTRIBUTORS SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIM ANY <br>EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTY OF FITNESS FOR HIGH RISK ACTIVITIES.</p><p>11.0 Responsibility for Claims. As between Licensor and Contributors, each <br>party is responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, <br>out of its utilization of rights under this License which specifically <br>disclaims warranties and limits any liability of the Licensor. This paragraph <br>is to be used in conjunction with and controlled by the Disclaimer Of <br>Warranties of Section 8, the Limitation Of Damages in Section 9, and the <br>disclaimer against use for High Risk Activities in Section 10. The Licensor <br>has thereby disclaimed all warranties and limited any damages that it is or <br>may be liable for. You agree to work with Licensor and Contributors to <br>distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis consistent with the terms <br>of this License including Sections 8, 9, and 10. Nothing herein is intended or <br>shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.</p><p>12.0 Termination. This License and all rights granted hereunder will terminate <br>immediately in the event of the circumstances described in Section 13.6 or if <br>applicable law prohibits or restricts You from fully and or specifically <br>complying with Sections 3, 4 and/or 6, or prevents the enforceability of any <br>of those Sections, and You must immediately discontinue any use of Licensed <br>Software.</p><p>12.1 Automatic Termination Upon Breach. This License and the rights granted <br>hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with the terms <br>herein and fail to cure such breach within thirty (30) days of becoming aware <br>of the breach. All sublicenses to the Licensed Software that are properly <br>granted shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions that, by <br>their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License, <br>shall survive.</p><p>12.2 Termination Upon Assertion of Patent Infringement. If You initiate <br>litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory <br>judgment actions) against Licensor or a Contributor (Licensor or Contributor <br>against whom You file such an action is referred to herein as \"Respondent\") <br>alleging that Licensed Software directly or indirectly infringes any patent, <br>then any and all rights granted by such Respondent to You under Sections 3 or <br>4 of this License shall terminate prospectively upon sixty (60) days notice <br>from Respondent (the \"Notice Period\") unless within that Notice Period You <br>either agree in writing (i) to pay Respondent a mutually agreeable reasonably <br>royalty for Your past or future use of Licensed Software made by such <br>Respondent, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to Licensed <br>Software against such Respondent. If within said Notice Period a reasonable <br>royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the <br>parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by <br>Licensor to You under Sections 3 and 4 automatically terminate at the <br>expiration of said Notice Period.</p><p>12.3 Reasonable Value of This License. If You assert a patent infringement <br>claim against Respondent alleging that Licensed Software directly or <br>indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by <br>license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement <br>litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by said <br>Respondent under Sections 3 and 4 shall be taken into account in determining <br>the amount or value of any payment or license.</p><p>12.4 No Retroactive Effect of Termination. In the event of termination under <br>this Section all end user license agreements (excluding licenses to <br>distributors and resellers) that have been validly granted by You or any <br>distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive termination.</p><p>13.0 Miscellaneous.</p><p>13.1 U.S. Government End Users.
