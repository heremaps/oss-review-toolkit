Contributor Grant.</p><p>Subject to third party intellectual property claims, each Contributor <br>hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license</p><p>(a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent <br>or <br>trademark) Licensable by Contributor, to use, reproduce, modify, <br>display, perform, sublicense and distribute the Modifications created <br>by such Contributor (or portions thereof) either on an unmodified <br>basis, with other Modifications, as Covered Code and/or as part of a <br>Larger Work; and</p><p>b) under Patent Claims infringed by the making, using, or selling of <br>Modifications made by that Contributor either alone and/or in <br>combination with its Contributor Version (or portions of such <br>combination), to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, and/or <br>otherwise dispose of: 1) Modifications made by that Contributor (or <br>portions thereof); and 2) the combination of Modifications made by <br>that Contributor with its Contributor Version (or portions of such <br>combination).</p><p>(c) the licenses granted in Sections 2.2(a) and 2.2(b) are effective <br>on the date Contributor first makes Commercial Use of the Covered <br>Code.</p><p>(d) notwithstanding Section 2.2(b) above, no patent license is <br>granted: 1) for any code that Contributor has deleted from the <br>Contributor Version; 2) separate from the Contributor Version; 3) for <br>infringements caused by: i) third party modifications of Contributor <br>Version or ii) the combination of Modifications made by that <br>Contributor with other software (except as part of the Contributor <br>Version) or other devices; or 4) under Patent Claims infringed by <br>Covered Code in the absence of Modifications made by that <br>Contributor.</p><p>3. Distribution Obligations.</p><p>3.1. Application of License.</p><p>The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are <br>governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation <br>Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be <br>distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version <br>of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a <br>copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You <br>distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code <br>version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this <br>License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include <br>an additional document offering the additional rights described in <br>Section 3.5.</p><p>3.2. Availability of Source Code.</p><p>Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be <br>made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License <br>either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted <br>Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an <br>Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic <br>Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12) <br>months after the date it initially became available, or at least six <br>(6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification <br>has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for <br>ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the <br>Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.</p><p>3.3. Description of Modifications.</p><p>You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a <br>file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and <br>the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that <br>the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original <br>Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the <br>Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an <br>Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the <br>origin or ownership of the Covered Code.</p><p>3.4. Intellectual Property Matters.</p><p>(a) Third Party Claims.</p><p>If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's <br>intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights <br>granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor <br>must include a text file with the Source Code distribution titled <br>\"../LEGAL'' which describes the claim and the party making the claim in <br>sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If <br>Contributor obtains such knowledge after the Modification is made <br>available as described in Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly <br>modify the LEGAL file in all copies Contributor makes available <br>thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate <br>mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who <br>received the Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.</p><p>(b) Contributor APIs.</p><p>If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming <br>interface (\"API\"../) and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses <br>which are reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must <br>also include this information in the LEGAL file.</p><p>(c) Representations.</p><p>Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section <br>3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's Modifications <br>are Contributor's original creation(s) and/or Contributor has <br>sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this <br>License</p><p>.</p><p>3.5. Required Notices.</p><p>You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source <br>Code. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source <br>Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a <br>location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely <br>to look for such a notice. If You created one or more Modification(s) <br>You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in <br>Exhibit A. You must also duplicate this License in any documentation <br>for the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership <br>rights relating to Covered Code. You may choose to offer, and to <br>charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability <br>obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You <br>may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial <br>Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than <br>any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is <br>offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial <br>Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the <br>Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, <br>support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.</p><p>3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.</p><p>You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the <br>requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, <br>and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of <br>the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License, <br>including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the <br>obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included <br>in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or <br>collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the <br>Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered <br>Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may <br>contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in <br>compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the <br>Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's <br>rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this <br>License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different <br>license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ <br>from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial <br>Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the <br>Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by <br>the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such <br>terms You offer.</p><p>3.7. Larger Works.</p><p>You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other <br>code <br>not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger <br>Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the <br>requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.</p><p>4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.</p><p>If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this <br>License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to <br>statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with <br>the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) <br>describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description <br>must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must <br>be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the <br>extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be <br>sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to <br>understand it.</p><p>5. Application of this License.</p><p>This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has <br>attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.</p><p>6. Versions of the License.</p><p>6.1. New Versions.</p><p>Sun Microsystems, Inc. (\"Sun\") may publish revised and/or new versions <br>of the License from time to time. Each version will be given a <br>distinguishing version number.</p><p>6.2. Effect of New Versions.</p><p>Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of <br>the <br>License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that <br>version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms <br>of any subsequent version of the License published by Sun. No one <br>other than Sun has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered <br>Code created under this License.</p><p>6.3. Derivative Works.</p><p>If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you <br>may <br>only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code <br>governed by this License), You must: (a) rename Your license so that <br>the phrases \"Sun,\" \"Sun Public License,\" or \"SPL\"../ or any confusingly <br>similar phrase do not appear in your license (except to note that your <br>license differs from this License) and (b) otherwise make it clear <br>that Your version of the license contains terms which differ from the <br>Sun Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer, <br>Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A <br>shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of this <br>License.)</p><p>7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.</p><p>COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN \"../AS IS'' BASIS, <br>WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, <br>WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF <br>DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. <br>THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE <br>IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, <br>YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE <br>COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER <br>OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF <br>ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS <br>DISCLAIMER.</p><p>8. TERMINATION.</p><p>8.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate <br>automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure <br>such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All <br>sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall <br>survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their <br>nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License <br>shall survive.</p><p>8.2. If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement <br>claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions) against Initial Developer <br>or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom <br>You file such action is referred to as \"Participant\") alleging <br>that:</p><p>(a) such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly <br>infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such <br>Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License <br>shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively, <br>unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i) <br>agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable <br>royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such <br>Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to <br>the Contributor Version against such Participant. If within 60 days <br>of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not <br>mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim <br>is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under <br>Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of <br>the 60 day notice period specified above.</p><p>(b) any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's <br>Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then <br>any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b) <br>and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used, <br>sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that <br>Participant.</p><p>8.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant <br>alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or <br>indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as <br>by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent <br>infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses <br>granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken <br>into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or <br>license.</p><p>8.4. In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, <br>all <br>end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) <br>which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder <br>prior to termination shall survive termination.</p><p>9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.</p><p>UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT <br>(INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL <br>DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, <br>OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR <br>ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY <br>CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, <br>WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER <br>COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN <br>INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF <br>LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY <br>RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW <br>PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE <br>EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO <br>THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p><p>10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.</p><p>The Covered Code is a \"commercial item,\" as that term is defined in <br>48 <br>C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of \"commercial computer software\" <br>and \"commercial computer software documentation,\"../ as such terms are <br>used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. <br>12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all <br>U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those rights <br>set forth herein.</p><p>11. MISCELLANEOUS.</p><p>This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject <br>matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be <br>unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent <br>necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by <br>California law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if <br>any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. <br>With respect to disputes in which at least one party is a citizen of, <br>or an entity chartered or registered to do business in the United <br>States of America, any litigation relating to this License shall be <br>subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern <br>District of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County, <br>California, with the losing party responsible for costs, including <br>without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and <br>expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on <br>Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. <br>Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract <br>shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this <br>License.</p><p>12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.</p><p>As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is <br>responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, <br>out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to <br>work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such <br>responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or <br>shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.</p><p>13. MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE.</p><p>Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as <br>?Multiple-Licensed?. ?Multiple-Licensed? means that the Initial <br>Developer permits you to utilize portions of the Covered Code under <br>Your choice of the alternative licenses, if any, specified by the <br>Initial Developer in the file described in Exhibit A.</p><p>Exhibit A -Sun Public License Notice.</p><p>The contents of this file are subject to the Sun Public License</p><p>Version 1.0 (the License); you may not use this file except in</p><p>compliance with the License.
