(<strong><em>“Ustream”</em></strong>, <strong><em>“we”</em></strong> or <strong><em>“us”</em></strong>)\r\n provides this Privacy Policy to inform you of our policies and \r\nprocedures regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personal \r\ninformation we receive from users of our website accessible at <a href=\"http://www.ustream.tv/\">www.ustream.tv</a> (the <strong><em>“Site”</em></strong>)\r\n and our proprietary video player platform which enables the sharing of \r\nlive and recorded video and audio content and chat on the Internet and \r\nvia computers and mobile devices by our users (any and all of the \r\nforegoing (the “Services”). The Services include Ustream’s proprietary \r\nembeddable video players, the Ustream channels, our software \r\napplications (including any updates, new versions or new releases \r\nthereof) including, but not limited to, our viewer, broadcaster and \r\nrecorder applications.</p><p>\r\nAs used in this policy, the terms \r\n“using” and “processing” information include using cookies on a \r\ncomputer, subjecting the information to statistical or other analysis \r\nand using or touching information in any way, including, but not limited\r\n to collecting, storing, evaluating, modifying, deleting, using, \r\ncombining, disclosing and transferring information within the United \r\nStates or internationally.</p><h3>\r\nInformation Collection and Use</h3><p>\r\nOur\r\n primary goals in collecting information are to provide and improve our \r\nServices, features and content, to administer your membership and to \r\nenable users to enjoy and easily navigate the Site.  We also may also \r\nuse your information in order to better understand how our Services are \r\nused.</p><p>\r\n<u>Personally Identifiable Information.</u></p><ul><li>In\r\n the course of using the Services, we ask you to provide us with certain\r\n personally identifiable information that can be used to contact or \r\nidentify you and administer your account (<strong><em>“Personal Information”</em></strong>).\r\n Personal Information may include, but is not limited to, your name, \r\nphone number, credit card or other billing information, email address \r\nand home and business postal addresses.  We use your Personal \r\nInformation mainly to provide the Services and administer your \r\ninquiries.</li><li>Please be aware that when you register to become a\r\n Ustream Member, other users of the Services may be able to see your \r\nscreen or user name, in addition to any comments or submissions that you\r\n post to the Site or submit via the Services.  We recommend that you \r\nguard your anonymity and sensitive information and that you not use your\r\n real name as your screen or user name to the extent that allows others \r\nto identify you.  If your use of the Services violates or potentially \r\nviolates Ustream’s <a href=\"http://www.ustream.tv/acceptableusepolicy\">Acceptable Use Policy</a>,\r\n your Personal Information may be shared with law enforcement and other \r\nthird parties in accordance with this Privacy Policy and subject to all \r\napplicable laws.</li><li>We also collect the other information that \r\nyou provide as part of your use of the Services, including via your \r\nregistration and the administration and personalization of your profile \r\nwebpage (e.g., without limitation zip code, gender, age and individual \r\npreferences) (<strong><em>“Non-Identifying Information”</em></strong>). \r\nCertain Non-Identifying Information would be considered a part of your \r\nPersonal Information if it were combined with other identifiers (for \r\nexample, combining your zip code with your street address) in a way that\r\n enables you to be identified. But the same pieces of information are \r\nconsidered Non-Identifying Information when they are taken alone or \r\ncombined only with other non-identifying information (for example, your \r\nviewing preferences). We may combine your Personal Information with \r\nNon-Identifying Information and aggregate it with information collected \r\nfrom other Ustream Users to attempt to provide you with a better \r\nexperience, to improve the quality and value of the Services and to \r\nanalyze and understand how our Services are used.</li><li>We also \r\nuse your Personal Information to contact you with Ustream newsletters, \r\nmarketing or promotional materials and other information that may be of \r\ninterest to you. Ustream Members who agree to the terms and conditions \r\nof the Ustream Terms of Service Agreement are given the opportunity to \r\nopt-in to receiving such communications from us in the future. If you \r\ndecide at any time that you no longer wish to receive such \r\ncommunications from us, please follow the unsubscribe instructions \r\nprovided in any of the communications or update your “user preferences” \r\ninformation. (See <strong><em>“Changing or Deleting Information,”</em></strong> below.)</li><li>Ustream\r\n will also share and use your Personal Information with Ustream Asia, \r\nand other networks, websites and entities affiliated, owned, controlled \r\nand/or connected with Ustream.  We will use your Personal Information in\r\n compliance with the terms of this Privacy Policy.</li><li>At times,\r\n we may offer special access to pay-per-view or other special \r\npromotional events (e.g., live broadcast of concerts), and we may share \r\nyour Personal Information with those entities and advertisers that are \r\nparticipating in such event.  Unless otherwise stated, we will only \r\nshare your name and email address to the such parties, so you may \r\nreceive newsletters or promotional materials from such entities.</li></ul><p>\r\n<u>Surveys and Promotions.</u> From time to time, we may provide you with the opportunity to participate in surveys, contests or sweepstakes (any of these a <strong><em>“Promotion”</em></strong>)\r\n via our Services. If you participate in a Promotion we will request \r\ncertain Personal Information from you. We use the Personal Information \r\nyou provide to us in these instances to administer your participation in\r\n the Promotion.  Participation in a Promotion is completely voluntary \r\nand you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this \r\ninformation.</p><p>\r\n<u>Log Data.</u>  As you use the Services, whether as a Ustream Member or a non-registered user just browsing (any of these, a <strong><em>“Ustream User”</em></strong>), our servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website (<strong><em>“Log Data”</em></strong>).\r\n This log data may include information such as your computer’s IP \r\naddress, browser type or the domain from which you are visiting. We use \r\nthis information to monitor and analyze use of the Services and for the \r\nSite’s technical administration. We do not treat Log Data as Personal \r\nInformation or use it in association with other Personal Information, \r\nthough we may aggregate, analyze and evaluate such information for the \r\nsame purposes as stated above regarding other Non-Identifying \r\nInformation.</p><h3>\r\nCookies</h3><p>\r\nLike many websites, we use \r\n“cookies” to collect information. A cookie is a small data file that we \r\ntransfer to your computer’s hard disk for record-keeping purposes. We \r\nuse cookies for two purposes. First, we utilize persistent cookies to \r\nsave your encrypted registration ID and login password for future logins\r\n to the Site as well as display preference settings (such as preferred \r\nlanguage). Second, we utilize session ID cookies to enable certain \r\nfeatures of the Services, to better understand how you interact with the\r\n Services and to monitor aggregate usage by Ustream Users and web \r\ntraffic routing on the Services. Unlike persistent cookies, session \r\ncookies are deleted from your computer when you close your browser. \r\nThird party advertisers on the Services may also place or read cookies \r\non your browser. You can instruct your browser, by editing its options, \r\nto stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie \r\nfrom the websites you visit. If you do not accept cookies, however, you \r\nmay not be able to use all portions of the Site or all functionality of \r\nthe Services.</p><p>\r\nWe may also use “pixel tags,” “web beacons,” “clear GIFs” or similar means (individually or collectively <strong><em>“Pixel Tags”</em></strong>)\r\n in connection with our Services to collect usage, demographic and \r\ngeographical location data.  A Pixel Tag is an electronic image, often a\r\n single pixel that is ordinarily not visible to users and may be \r\nassociated with cookies on a user’s hard drive. Pixel Tags allow us to \r\ncount users who have visited certain pages of the Site, to deliver \r\nbranded services and to help determine the effectiveness of promotional \r\nor advertising campaigns.</p><h3>\r\nInformation Sharing and Disclosure</h3><p>\r\n<u>Ustream Members.</u>\r\n When you register through the Site and submit your Personal Information\r\n to create a profile webpage, Ustream Users will see your “Screen Name” \r\nand the month and year you first registered with Ustream (<strong><em>“Required Member Identifiers”</em></strong>). You can choose what other Personal Information you provide as part of your profile (<strong><em>“Other Member Information”</em></strong>)\r\n and in some cases you can choose whether to share that information \r\npublicly on the Site by making selections via the “user preferences” \r\nsection of your profile webpage. Providing Other Member Information is \r\nvoluntary and should correlate with the degree of interaction you want \r\nto have with Ustream Users. We recommend that you guard your anonymity \r\nand sensitive information.</p><p>\r\n<u>Notifications and Following other Ustream Members.</u>\r\n  Ustream Members can also choose to join a “crowd” of other Ustream \r\nMembers and follow their favorite Ustream broadcaster. If you choose to \r\nfollow another Ustream Member, you will provide that Ustream Member with\r\n your public Ustream identity. By joining the crowd of another Ustream \r\nmember, you also opt-in for notifications sent to you within the Ustream\r\n platform.  You may also be followed outside of the Ustream platform, if\r\n you expose and make public your identity, email address and social \r\nnetwork identity.</p><p>\r\n<u>Aggregate Information and Non-Identifying Information.</u>\r\n We may share aggregated information that includes your Personal \r\nInformation, Non-Identifying Information and Log Data with third parties\r\n for industry analysis and demographic profiling and to deliver targeted\r\n advertising about other products and services.</p><p>\r\n<u>Service Providers.</u>\r\n We may employ third party companies and individuals to facilitate our \r\nServices, to provide the Services on our behalf, to perform Site-related\r\n services or to assist us in analyzing how our Services are used (each a\r\n <strong><em>“Service Provider”</em></strong>). The types of Service \r\nProviders we use include, without limitation, those that provide the \r\nfollowing types of services: credit card processing, accounting, \r\ncustomer relationship management, website maintenance, notification \r\nservices, database management and web analytics.  These third parties \r\nhave access to your Personal Information only to perform these tasks on \r\nour behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other \r\npurpose.</p><p>\r\n<u>SpotXchange.</u> SpotXchange serves ads on the Site\r\n and through the Services and collects information about users’ \r\ninteraction with those ads, as described in the SpotXchange Privacy \r\nPolicy, located at <a href=\"http://www.spotxchange.com/spx_privacypolicy.html\">http://www.spotxchange.com/spx_privacypolicy.html</a>.</p><p>\r\n<u>Third Party Social Networking Services.</u>\r\n  As a Ustream Member you can link your account information with certain\r\n social networking services (“SNSs”) and broadcast your activities and \r\nother data to your friends.  In these instances, depending on the “user \r\npreferences” you set in your Ustream account, with your permission and \r\non your behalf we will share the information contained in your Ustream \r\naccount (e.g., Ustream profile page, channel page and any other \r\ninformation you deem public in any content you create on the Site) with \r\nthe SNS. We also receive certain information (which may include your \r\nPersonal Information) in accordance with the privacy settings you have \r\nset in your SNS account, if any. Other than what we may share with the \r\nSNS in connection with your linking of accounts, the personal \r\ninformation a SNS has about you is obtained by the SNS independent of \r\nour Services. Other services follow different rules regarding the use or\r\n disclosure of the personal information you submit to them.  We \r\nencourage you to read the privacy policies or statements of the other \r\nonline services you use.</p><p>\r\n<u>Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement.</u>\r\n Ustream cooperates with government and law enforcement officials or \r\nprivate parties to enforce and comply with the law. We will disclose any\r\n information about you to government or law enforcement officials or \r\nprivate parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or \r\nappropriate to respond to claims and legal process (including but not \r\nlimited to subpoenas), to protect the property and rights of Ustream or a\r\n third party, to protect the safety of the public or any person, or to \r\nprevent or stop any illegal, unethical or legally actionable activity.</p><p>\r\n<u>Business Transfers.</u>\r\n  Ustream may sell, transfer or otherwise share some or all of its \r\nassets, including your Personal Information, in connection with a \r\nmerger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets or in the event of\r\n bankruptcy. If Ustream becomes involved in a merger, acquisition, \r\nreorganization or any form of sale of some or all of its assets, we will\r\n provide notice to you before your Personal Information is transferred \r\nand becomes subject to a different privacy policy.</p><h3>\r\nChanging or Deleting Your Information</h3><p>\r\nAll\r\n Ustream Members may review, update, correct or delete the Personal \r\nInformation in their registration profile by contacting us. If you \r\ncompletely delete all such information, then your account may become \r\ndeactivated. If you would like us to delete your record in our system, \r\nplease contact us and we will attempt to accommodate your request. See \r\nbelow for privacy contact information.</p><h3>\r\nSecurity</h3><p>\r\nUstream\r\n is very concerned with safeguarding your information.  We employ \r\nreasonable physical, technological, and administrative security measures\r\n and attempt to ensure they are applicable under the circumstances.  No \r\nmethod of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic \r\nstorage, is 100% secure, however.  Therefore, while we strive to use \r\ncommercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we \r\ncannot guarantee its absolute security.</p><p>\r\nWe will make any \r\nlegally required disclosures of any breach of the security, \r\nconfidentiality or integrity of your unencrypted electronically stored \r\nPersonal Data (as defined in applicable state statutes on security \r\nbreach notification) to you via email or conspicuous posting on this \r\nSite in the most expedient time possible and without unreasonable delay,\r\n insofar as consistent with (i) the legitimate needs of law enforcement \r\nor (ii) any measures necessary to determine the scope of the breach and \r\nrestore the reasonable integrity of the data system.</p><h3>\r\nInternational Transfer</h3><p>\r\nYour\r\n information may be transferred to and maintained on computers located \r\noutside of your state, province, country or other governmental \r\njurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in\r\n your jurisdiction. If you are located outside the United States and \r\nchoose to provide information to us, Ustream transfers Personal \r\nInformation to the United States and processes it there. Your submission\r\n of such information represents your agreement to that transfer.</p><h3>\r\nLinks to Other Sites</h3><p>\r\nThe\r\n Services contain links to other websites. If you choose to visit an \r\nadvertiser by “clicking on” a banner ad or other type of advertisement, \r\nor click on another third-party link, you will be directed to that third\r\n party’s website. The fact that we link to a website or present a banner\r\n ad or other type of advertisement is not an endorsement, authorization \r\nor representation of our affiliation with that third party, nor is it an\r\n endorsement of their privacy or information security policies or \r\npractices. We do not exercise control over third party websites. These \r\nother websites may place their own cookies or other files on your \r\ncomputer, collect data or solicit personal information from you. This \r\nPrivacy Policy addresses the use and disclosure of information that we \r\ncollect from you through our Services. Other sites follow different \r\nrules regarding the use or disclosure of the personal information you \r\nsubmit to them. We encourage you to read the privacy policies or \r\nstatements of the other websites you visit.</p><h3>\r\nOur Policy Toward Children</h3><p>\r\nUstream\r\n does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from \r\nchildren under 13.  If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or \r\nher child has provided us with Personal Information without their \r\nconsent, he or she should contact us at <a href=\"mailto:privacy@ustream.tv\">Privacy@ustream.tv</a>\r\n If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with Personal \r\nInformation, we will delete such information from our files.</p><h3>\r\nContacting Us</h3><p>\r\nIf you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at <a href=\"mailto:privacy@ustream.tv\">Privacy@ustream.tv</a> or at:</p><address>\r\n   Privacy Matters<br>   c/o Ustream, Inc.<br>   410 Townsend Street, Ste 400<br>   San Francisco, CA  94107   </address><div>\r\nATTENTION:<br>PLEASE\r\n READ THESE TERMS OF SERVICE (\"TERMS\") CAREFULLY BEFORE USING THE \r\nUSTREAM WEBSITE (\"SITE\").
