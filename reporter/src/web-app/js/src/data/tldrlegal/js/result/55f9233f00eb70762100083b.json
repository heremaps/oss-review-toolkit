If the Licensee wishes to</p><p>benefit from additional free trials it must contact the Licensor to request this and Licensor may</p><p>(in its absolute discretion) decline or agree to any such request. If the Licensor discovers that</p><p>the Licensee has benefitted from more than one free trial, without obtaining the Licensor’s prior</p><p>written consent, the Licensor reserves the right to charge the Licensee the applicable licence</p><p>fee for the Software in full.</p><p>1.4</p><p>The Licensee acknowledges that the trial version of the Software may have limited or</p><p>restricted functionality and that the Licensor shall be under no obligation to provide technical</p><p>support in relation to the trial version of the Software.</p><div>\r\n<div>2<p>Full licence</p><p>2.1</p><p>If the Licensee has purchased a full licence of the Software, provided that the Licensee has</p><p>paid the applicable licence fee in full, the Licensor grants to the Licensee, perpetual, non-</p><p>exclusive, non-transferable licence to do the following:</p><p>2.1.1</p><p>download and store a copy of the Software and Documentation on the Licensee’s</p><p>own internal computer systems; and</p><p>2.1.2</p><p>permit the Licensee’s Licensed Developers (as defined in Clause 2.2 below) to use</p><p>the Software in connection with the development of the Licensee’s own software</p><p>applications (“Licensee Applications”); and</p><p>2.1.3</p><p>publish or redistribute relevant parts of the Software in object code form only and</p><p>only as a fully integrated part or component of a complete Licensee Application.</p><p>2.2</p><p>The Licensee must purchase a separate licence for each of its developers who are</p><p>permitted to use the Software in accordance with Clause 2.1.2 above. Each licence purchased</p><p>enables the Licensee to permit a single named developer who is employed by the Licensee or</p><p>working as a contractor for the licence (a “Licensed Developer”) to use the Software to develop</p><p>Licensee Applications for the Licensee. Each Licensed Developer working directly with the</p><p>Software must hold a licence. The Licensee agrees to keep up to date records of all Licensed</p><p>Developers who it has permitted to use the Software and to make such records available to the</p><p>Licensor on request. The Licensee also agrees to ensure that all Licensed Developers, who it</p><p>permits to use the Software, comply with the terms and conditions of this Agreement.</p><p>2.3</p><p>Except as expressly set out in Clause 2.1 and Clause 2.2 above no other rights or licences</p><p>to use the Software or Documentation are granted to the Licensee under the terms of this</p><p>Agreement.

The Licensor may (in its absolute discretion) grant the Licensee such permission</p><div>\r\n<div>(subject to such terms as the Licensor may require) or refuse to do so.<p>3</p><p>Licensee’s Undertakings</p><p>3.1</p><p>Except as expressly set out in this Agreement or as permitted by any local law, the Licensee</p><p>undertakes:</p><p>3.1.1</p><p>not to copy the Software or Documentation except where such copying is</p><p>incidental to or strictly necessary for the licensed use of the Software or where it is</p><p>necessary for the purpose of back-up or operational security;</p><p>3.1.2</p><p>not to rent, lease, sub-license, loan, sell, resell, translate, merge, adapt, vary modify</p><p>the Software or Documentation except to the extent expressly permitted under Clause</p><p>2.1 above;</p><p>3.1.3</p><p>not to make alterations to, or modifications of, the whole or any part of the</p><p>Software;</p><p>3.1.4</p><p>not to disassemble, de-compile or reverse engineer nor attempt to do any such</p><p>things except to the extent that (by virtue of section 296A of the Copyright, Designs and</p><p>Patents Act 1988) such actions cannot be prohibited because they are essential for the</p><p>purpose of achieving inter- operability of the Software with another software program,</p><p>and provided that the information obtained by the Licensee during such activities: (i) is</p><p>used only for the purpose of achieving inter-operability of the Software with another</p><p>software program; (ii) is not disclosed or communicated without the Licensor’s prior</p><p>written consent to any third party to whom it is not necessary to disclose or</p><p>communicate it; and (iii) is not used to create any software which is substantially similar</p><p>to, or competitive with, the Software. Notwithstanding this Clause 3.1.4, the Licensee</p><p>agrees that it is required to contact the Licensor prior to undertaking any of the activities</p><p>set out in this Clause in order to establish whether such activities are in fact required to</p><p>achieve the desired inter-operability;</p><p>3.1.5</p><p>to keep all copies of the Software secure and to maintain accurate and up-to-date</p><p>records of the number and locations of all copies of the Software;</p><p>3.1.6</p><p>to supervise and control use of the Software and ensure that the Software is used</p><p>by its Licensed Developers, employees and representatives and (if appropriate)</p><p>licensees in accordance with the terms of this Agreement;</p><p>3.1.7</p><p>to include the copyright notice of the Licensor on all entire and partial copies of</p><p>the Software in any form;</p><p>3.1.8</p><p>not to remove or hide by any means, any watermark images or references to</p><p>ShinobiControls or the Software from any software which uses the Software.</p><p>3.2</p><p>The Licensee must permit the Licensor its representatives, at all reasonable times and on</p><p>reasonable advance notice, to inspect and have access to any premises, and to the computer</p><p>equipment located there, at which the Software or the Documentation is being kept or used,</p><p>and any records kept pursuant to this Agreement, for the purpose of ensuring that the Licensee</p><p>is complying with the terms of this Agreement.</p><p>4</p><p>Maintenance and Support Services</p><p>4.1</p><p>The Licensor operates two levels of support and maintenance: “ShinobiCare” and</p><p>“ShinobiCare Plus”. The ShinobiCare service and the ShinobiCare Plus services are referred to</p><p>collectively in this Agreement as “Maintenance and Support Services”.</p><p>4.2</p><p>The ShinobiCare service entitles the Licensee to access and use such new releases to the</p><div>\r\n<div>Software (in object code form only) as the Licensor may make available from time to time. If<p>the Licensee has purchased a full licence of the Software and paid the applicable licence fee in</p><p>full, the Licensee is entitled to benefit from the Licensor’s ShinobiCare service in relation to that</p><p>Software for no additional charge for a period of one (1) year from the date that they</p><p>purchased a full licence of the Software. Thereafter, the Licensee must pay the applicable</p><p>annual support fee to continue to benefit from the ShinobiCare service.</p><p>4.3</p><p>If the Licensee has purchased ShinobiCare Plus and has paid any applicable annual</p><p>support fees for such service, in addition to having access to new releases of the Software (as</p><p>described in Clause 4.2) the Licensee shall be entitled to receive technical support services in</p><p>relation to the Software. Such technical support services shall be provided in accordance with</p><p>the provisions of Schedule 1.</p><p>4.4</p><p>Any new releases of the Software which are made available to the Licensee under Clause</p><p>4.2 shall be deemed to be part of the Software and subject to the terms and conditions set out</p><p>in this Agreement.</p><p>5</p><p>Intellectual Property Rights</p><p>5.1</p><p>The Licensee acknowledges that all intellectual property rights in the Software and the</p><p>Documentation throughout the World belong to the Licensor, that rights in the Software are</p><p>licensed (not sold) to the Licensee, and that the Licensee has no rights in, or to, the Software or</p><p>the Documentation other than the right to use them in accordance with the terms of this</p><p>Agreement.</p><p>5.2</p><p>The Licensee acknowledges that it has no right under this Agreement to have access to the</p><p>Software in source code form or in unlocked coding or with comments.</p><p>5.3</p><p>The integrity of this Software may be protected by technical protection measures (“TPM”)</p><p>so that our intellectual property rights, including copyright, in the Software are not</p><p>misappropriated. The Licensee must not attempt in any way to remove or circumvent any such</p><p>TPM, nor to apply, manufacture for sale, hire, import, distribute, sell, nor let, offer, advertise or</p><p>expose for sale or hire, nor have in its possession for private or commercial purposes, any</p><p>means whose sole intended purpose is to facilitate the unauthorised removal or circumvention</p><p>of such TPM.</p><p>6</p><p>Warranties</p><p>6.1</p><p>During the Trial Period the Software is made available to the Licensee free of charge on an</p><p>“AS IS” basis and, to the maximum extent permitted by law, the Licensor disclaims all express</p><p>or implied warranties, including but not limited to implied warranties of satisfactory quality,</p><p>fitness for a particular purposes and non- infringement.</p><p>6.2</p><p>If the Licensee has purchased a full licence of the Software, the Licensor warrants that for</p><p>a period of thirty (30) days after the Licensee has purchased a full licence of the Software (the</p><p>“Warranty Period”) the Software will, when properly used, perform substantially in accordance</p><p>with the functions described in the accompanying Documentation. If, within the Warranty</p><p>Period, the Licensee notifies the Licensor in writing of any defect or fault in the Software in</p><p>consequence of which it fails to perform substantially in accordance with the Documentation,</p><p>and such defect or fault does not result from the Licensee having amended the Software or</p><p>used it in contravention of the terms of this Agreement, the Licensor will, at its sole option,</p><p>either (i) repair or replace the Software (provided that the Licensee makes available all</p><p>information that may be necessary to assist the Licensor in resolving the defect or fault,</p><div>\r\n<div>including sufficient information to enable the Licensor to recreate the defect or fault); or (ii)<p>refund to the Licensee any licence fees paid to use the Software. This Clause sets out the</p><p>Licensee’s sole remedy and the Licensor’s sole liability for any breach of the warranty detailed</p><p>in this Clause 6.1.</p><p>6.3</p><p>Notwithstanding Clause 6.2, the Licensee acknowledges that the Software has not been</p><p>developed to meet the Licensee’s individual requirements and that it is therefore the Licensee’s</p><p>responsibility to ensure that the facilities and functions of the Software, as described in the</p><p>Documentation, meet the Licensee’s requirements.</p><p>6.4</p><p>Notwithstanding Clause 6.2, the Licensee acknowledges that the Software may not be free</p><p>of bugs or errors and the Licensee agrees that the existence of any minor errors shall not</p><p>constitute a breach of this Agreement.</p><p>6.5</p><p>The Licensor warrants that it shall perform any Maintenance and Support Services in</p><p>accordance with this Agreement using reasonable skill and care. If the Licensor fails to</p><p>perform the Maintenance and Support Services accordance with this warranty, the Licensor</p><p>will, at its sole option, either (i) remedy or resolve the defective performance of the</p><p>Maintenance and Support Services or re-perform the Maintenance and Support Services in</p><p>question for no additional charge (provided that the Licensee makes available all information</p><p>that may be necessary to assist the Licensor to do so); or (ii) refund to the Licensee any fees</p><p>the Licensee has paid for the Maintenance and Support Services in question. This Clause sets</p><p>out the Licensee’s sole remedy and the Licensor’s sole liability for any breach of the warranty</p><p>detailed in this Clause 6.5.</p><p>7</p><p>Licensor’s Liability</p><p>7.1</p><p>Nothing in this Agreement shall limit or exclude the liability of either party for death or</p><p>personal injury resulting from negligence or for fraud, fraudulent misrepresentation.</p><p>7.2</p><p>Subject to Clause 7.1, the Licensor’s liability for losses suffered by the Licensee arising out</p><p>of or in connection with this Agreement, whether arising in contract, tort (including negligence),</p><p>misrepresentation or otherwise, shall (to the fullest extent permitted by law) exclude: (a) loss</p><p>of income; (b) loss of business profits or contracts; (c) business interruption; (d) loss of the</p><p>use of money or anticipated savings; (e) loss of information; (f) loss of opportunity, goodwill or</p><p>reputation; (g) loss of, damage to or corruption of data; or (h) any indirect or consequential loss</p><p>or damage of any kind howsoever arising and whether caused by tort (including negligence),</p><p>breach of contract or otherwise.</p><p>7.3</p><p>Subject to Clause 7.1, the Licensor’s maximum aggregate liability under or in connection</p><p>with this Agreement, or any collateral contract, whether in contract, tort (including negligence)</p><p>or otherwise, shall be limited to a sum equal to the licence fees and any maintenance and</p><p>support fees paid by the Licensee to the Licensor under this Agreement.</p><p>7.4</p><p>This Agreement sets out the full extent of the Licensor’s obligations and liabilities in</p><p>respect of the supply of the Software and Documentation and any Maintenance and Support</p><p>Services. In particular, there are no conditions, warranties, representations or other terms,</p><p>express or implied, that are binding on the Licensor except as specifically stated in this</p><p>Agreement. Any condition, warranty, representation or other term concerning the supply of the</p><p>Software and Documentation which might otherwise be implied into, or incorporated in, this</p><p>Agreement, or any collateral contract, whether by statute, common law or otherwise, is hereby</p><p>excluded to the fullest extent permitted by law.</p><div>\r\n<div>8<p>Term and Termination</p><p>8.1</p><p>If the Licensee has opted for a free trial of the Software, this Agreement shall come into</p><p>force on the date that the Licensee downloaded the trial version of the Software and (unless</p><p>terminated earlier in accordance with Clause 8.3) shall continue until the end of the Trial</p><p>Period.</p><p>8.2</p><p>If the Licensee has purchased a full licence of the software this agreement shall</p><p>commence on the date that the Licensee purchased a full licence of the Software and shall</p><p>continue indefinitely unless and until terminated in accordance with Clause 8.3.</p><p>8.3</p><p>The Licensee may terminate this Agreement at any time by destroying the Software and</p><p>Documentation together with all copies in any form.
