Contributor Grant. <br>Each Contributor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, <br>non-exclusive license, subject to third party intellectual property <br>claims:</p><p>(a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or <br>trademark) to use, reproduce, modify, display, perform, <br>sublicense and distribute the Modifications created by such <br>Contributor (or portions thereof) either on an unmodified <br>basis, with other Modifications, as Covered Code or as part <br>of a Larger Work; and</p><p>(b) under patents now or hereafter owned or controlled by <br>Contributor, to to make, have made, use and sell (``offer to <br>sell and import'') the Contributor Version (or portions <br>thereof), but solely to the extent that any such patent is <br>reasonably necessary to enable You to Utilize the <br>Contributor Version (or portions thereof), and not to any <br>greater extent that may be necessary to Utilize further <br>Modifications or combinations</p><p>3. Distribution Obligations.</p><p>3.1. Application of License. <br>The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are <br>governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation <br>Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be <br>distributed only under the terms of this License or a future <br>version of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must <br>include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code <br>You distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source <br>Code version that alters or restricts the applicable version of <br>this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may <br>include an additional document offering the additional rights <br>described in Section 3.5.</p><p>3.2. Availability of Source Code. <br>Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must <br>be made available, prior to any use, except for internal <br>development and practice, in Source Code form under the terms of <br>this License either on the same media as an Executable version or <br>via an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom <br>you made an Executable version available; and if made available via <br>Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at <br>least twelve (12) months after the date it initially became <br>available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent version of <br>that particular Modification has been made available to such <br>recipients. You shall notify the Initial Developer of the <br>Modification and the location of the Source Code via the contact <br>means provided for in the Developer Specific license. Initial <br>Developer will be acting as maintainer of the Source Code and may <br>provide an Electronic Distribution mechanism for the Modification <br>to be made available.</p><p>3.3. Description of Modifications. <br>You must cause all Covered Code to which you contribute to contain <br>a file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code <br>and the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement <br>that the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from <br>Original Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the <br>name of the Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in <br>any notice in an Executable version or related documentation in <br>which You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Code.</p><p>3.4. Intellectual Property Matters</p><p>(a) Third Party Claims. <br>If You have knowledge that a party claims an intellectual <br>property right in particular functionality or code (or its <br>utilization under this License), you must include a text <br>file with the source code distribution titled \"LEGAL\" which <br>describes the claim and the party making the claim in <br>sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to <br>contact. If you obtain such knowledge after You make Your <br>Modification available as described in Section 3.2, You <br>shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies You make <br>available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as <br>notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) <br>reasonably calculated to inform those who received the <br>Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.</p><p>(b) Representations.</p><p>Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to <br>Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that <br>Contributor's Modifications are Contributor's original <br>creation(s) and/or Contributor has sufficient rights to <br>grant the rights conveyed by this License.</p><p>3.5. Required Notices. <br>You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the <br>Source Code, and this License in any documentation for the Source <br>Code, where You describe recipients' rights relating to Covered <br>Code. If You created one or more Modification(s), You may add your <br>name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. If it <br>is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file <br>due to its structure, then you must include such notice in a <br>location (such as a relevant directory file) where a user would be <br>likely to look for such a notice. You may choose to offer, and to <br>charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability <br>obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You <br>may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial <br>Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear <br>that any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation <br>is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the <br>Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred <br>by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of <br>warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.</p><p>3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions. <br>You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the <br>requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered <br>Code, and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code <br>version of the Covered Code is available under the terms of this <br>License, including a description of how and where You have <br>fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be <br>conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable version, <br>related documentation or collateral in which You describe <br>recipients' rights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute <br>the Executable version of Covered Code under a license of Your <br>choice, which may contain terms different from this License, <br>provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License <br>and that the license for the Executable version does not attempt to <br>limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code version <br>from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the <br>Executable version under a different license You must make it <br>absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are <br>offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any <br>Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer <br>and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial <br>Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You <br>offer. If you distribute executable versions containing Covered <br>Code, you must reproduce the notice in Exhibit B in the <br>documentation and/or other materials provided with the product.</p><p>3.7. Larger Works. <br>You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other <br>code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the <br>Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure <br>the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered <br>Code.</p><p>4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.</p><p>If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this <br>License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to <br>statute or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of <br>this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) Cite all of <br>the statutes or regulations that prohibit you from complying fully <br>with this license. (c) describe the limitations and the code they <br>affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file <br>described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all <br>distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited <br>by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently <br>detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand <br>it.</p><p>5. Application of this License.</p><p>This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has <br>attached the notice in Exhibit A, and to related Covered Code.</p><p>6. Versions of the License.</p><p>6.1. New Versions. <br>License Author may publish revised and/or new versions of the <br>License from time to time. Each version will be given a <br>distinguishing version number and shall be submitted to <br>opensource.org for certification.</p><p>6.2. Effect of New Versions. <br>Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of <br>the License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of <br>that version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under <br>the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by <br>Initial Developer. No one other than Initial Developer has the <br>right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created under <br>this License.</p><p>6.3. Derivative Works. <br>If you create or use a modified version of this License, except in <br>association with the required Developer Specific License described <br>in section 6.4, (which you may only do in order to apply it to code <br>which is not already Covered Code governed by this License), you <br>must (a) rename Your license so that the phrases ``Open'', <br>``OpenPL'', ``OPL'' or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear <br>anywhere in your license and (b) otherwise make it clear that your <br>version of the license contains terms which differ from the Open <br>Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer, <br>Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A <br>shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of this <br>License.)</p><p>6.4. Required Additional Developer Specific License</p><p>This license is a union of the following two parts that should be <br>found as text files in the same place (directory), in the order of <br>preeminence:</p><p>[1] A Developer specific license.</p><p>[2] The contents of this file OPL_1_0.TXT, stating the general <br>licensing policy of the software.</p><p>In case of conflicting dispositions in the parts of this license, <br>the terms of the lower-numbered part will always be superseded by <br>the terms of the higher numbered part.</p><p>7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.</p><p>COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN \"AS IS\" BASIS, <br>WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, <br>WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF <br>DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR <br>NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF <br>THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE <br>DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER <br>CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR <br>CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART <br>OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER <br>EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.</p><p>8. TERMINATION.</p><p>8.1 Termination upon Breach</p><p>This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate <br>automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure <br>such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All <br>sublicenses to the Covered Code, which are properly granted, shall <br>survive any termination of this License. Provisions that, by their <br>nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License <br>shall survive.</p><p>8.2. Termination Upon Litigation. If You initiate litigation by <br>asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declatory judgment <br>actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial <br>Developer or Contributor against whom You file such action is referred <br>to as \"Participant\") alleging that:</p><p>(a) such Participant's Contributor Version directly or <br>indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights <br>granted by such Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or <br>2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant <br>terminate prospectively, unless if within 60 days after receipt <br>of notice You either: (i) agree in writing to pay Participant a <br>mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and future <br>use of Modifications made by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw <br>Your litigation claim with respect to the Contributor Version <br>against such Participant. If within 60 days of notice, a <br>reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually <br>agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim <br>is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You <br>under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the <br>expiration of the 60 day notice period specified above.</p><p>(b) any software, hardware, or device, other than such <br>Participant's Contributor Version, directly or indirectly <br>infringes any patent, then any rights granted to You by such <br>Participant under Sections 2.1(b) and 2.2(b) are revoked <br>effective as of the date You first made, used, sold, <br>distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that <br>Participant.</p><p>8.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant <br>alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or <br>indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as <br>by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent <br>infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses <br>granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken <br>into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or <br>license.</p><p>8.4. In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all <br>end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) <br>which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder <br>prior to termination shall survive termination.</p><p>9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.</p><p>UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT <br>(INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL THE INITIAL <br>DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, <br>OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY OTHER <br>PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES <br>OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF <br>GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND <br>ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE <br>BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF <br>LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY <br>RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW <br>PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE <br>EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO <br>THAT EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p><p>10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.</p><p>The Covered Code is a ``commercial item,'' as that term is defined in <br>48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of ``commercial computer <br>software'' and ``commercial computer software documentation,'' as such <br>terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 <br>C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), <br>all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those <br>rights set forth herein.</p><p>11. MISCELLANEOUS.</p><p>This section was intentionally left blank. The contents of this <br>section are found in the corresponding addendum described above.</p><p>12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.</p><p>Except in cases where another Contributor has failed to comply with <br>Section 3.4, You are responsible for damages arising, directly or <br>indirectly, out of Your utilization of rights under this License, <br>based on the number of copies of Covered Code you made available, the <br>revenues you received from utilizing such rights, and other relevant <br>factors. You agree to work with affected parties to distribute with <br>Initial Developer responsibility on an equitable basis.</p><p>EXHIBIT A.</p><p>Text for this Exhibit A is found in the corresponding addendum, <br>described in section 6.4 above, text file provided by the Initial <br>Developer.
