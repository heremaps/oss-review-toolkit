You will be responsible for any bank fees or other charges related to such withdrawals. Any objection relating to any accounting statement or any legal claims arising therefrom must be made (and any lawsuit commenced) no later than one (1) year after the date the statement is initially sent to you, and you waive any longer statute of limitations that may be permitted by law.</li><li>The Gross Receipts in your TuneCore account may be held by Company in an interest bearing account. Company may, in its sole discretion, retain all interest earned on the Gross Receipts or pay to you all or a portion of such interest.</li><li>In the event that Company has, in its good faith discretion, reason to suspect that any Composition submitted by you to Company is not in compliance with the terms of section 4 below, or if Company is presented with a claim of infringement of copyright, trademark, right or publicity or other intellectual property right, or failure to comply with any third party license requirement or any other claim which, if true, would constitute your breach of, or non-compliance with, any of your representations, warranties and agreements hereunder, you agree that Company may discontinue the posting of your share of Gross Receipts with respect to such Composition to your TuneCore account and block your ability to otherwise withdraw funds therefrom until satisfactory resolution of the matter is obtained. Furthermore, you agree that you will forfeit such revenues if Company determines that they are the result of infringement or fraud.</li><li>If Company, in its reasonable discretion, determines that any infringing or fraudulent activities may have been caused by your or your affiliates acts or omissions, any costs incurred by Company (including legal fees and expenses) in connection therewith may, in addition to other remedies, be deducted by Company from any monies otherwise payable to you by Company. Furthermore, if in Company’s reasonable business judgment it elects to engage an attorney to review and/or respond to a claim of fraud and/or infringement with respect to a Composition(s), Company shall, in its sole discretion, have the right to deduct from your TuneCore account or charge your Payment Method (defined in section 5(b) below) a minimum of Three Hundred Dollars ($300) to offset the costs of associated legal fees and expenses.</li></ol></li><li>THIRD PARTY OBLIGATIONS.\r\n<p>You shall be solely responsible for the payment of all compensation due songwriters, licensors, income participants and other third parties to whom you are obligated to pay a portion of the income from any of the Compositions. You warrant and represent that all such songwriters, licensors, income participants and other third parties to whom you are obligated to pay a portion of the income from the Compositions shall look solely to you for any such payments and you hereby agree to indemnify Company and hold Company harmless from and against any and all claims, demands or actions by any such songwriters, licensors, income participants and other third parties for any such payments in accordance with the indemnification provisions of the Terms of Service.</p></li><li>WARRANTIES AND REPRESENTATIONS.\r\n<p>You warrant and represent that you are at least eighteen (18) years of age and that all of the Compositions, including, without limitation, any interpolated third party material embodied therein, metadata and any other materials furnished by you to Company or relating to the Compositions are owned or controlled by you and the use thereof as described or contemplated herein shall not infringe on the copyrights, trademark rights, publicity rights or other rights of any person or entity; and that Company shall have the right to exploit same in any manner hereunder free from adverse claim and without any obligation to make any payment of any nature to any person or entity other than the amounts payable to you hereunder.</p></li><li>COMPANY FEES.\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>You shall pay Company a one-time, non-refundable fee (the “Set Up Fee”), as set forth on Company’s website, to cover Company’s administrative expenses with respect to updating your catalog of Compositions.</li><li>You agree that Company is authorized to deduct the Set Up Fee, any applicable taxes and other charges you may incur in connection with your use of the administration services directly from your TuneCore account or charge such fees to any alternate payment method you provide to Company (such as a valid PayPal account, credit card or debit card, each a “Payment Method”). For the avoidance of doubt, if you or Company terminates this agreement for any of the reasons set forth herein, you will not be entitled to a full or partial reimbursement of the Set Up Fee. Furthermore, if for any reason you fail to make a payment or a payment is reversed hereunder via the Payment Method or any other method after agreeing to these Terms of Service, Company will be entitled to recoup, at its sole discretion, the Set Up Fee (plus a Twenty-Five Dollar ($25.00) administrative fee), by any means necessary, including the right to keep your account active and collect any resulting royalties until the Set Up Fee is fully recouped. It is your responsibility to notify Company if your Payment Method has changed by making the appropriate changes to your TuneCore account settings. If you do not provide a valid Payment Method your service may be disconnected or interrupted at Company’s sole discretion.</li></ol></li><li>ADMINISTRATION TERM / POST-TERM COLLECTION PERIOD / RETENTION PERIOD.\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>The “Administration Term” of this agreement shall be for an initial period of one (1) year, commencing on the date the Set Up Fee is received and processed by Company. After the initial period, the Administration Term shall automatically renew and extend for additional one (1) year periods unless you give Company written notice of termination at least sixty (60) days prior to the end of the period then in effect.</li><li>Company shall have the right to collect all income relating to the Compositions earned prior to the beginning of the Administration Term, but not yet collected, as well as all (i) income generated within the United States during the Administration Term for a period of twelve (12) months immediately following the end of the Administration Term (or, if applicable, the extended Administration Term) solely in the event such income generated is not remitted to Company during such Administration Term and (ii) all income generated outside of the United States during the Administration Term for a period of eighteen (18) months immediately following the end of the Administration Term (or, if applicable, the extended Administration Term) solely in the event such income generated is not remitted to Company during such Administration Term.</li><li>Furthermore, you acknowledge and agree that for any Composition in which Company’s creative services team and/or a third party licensee secures a third party license (e.g., local cover versions of Compositions, local print compilations of Compositions; synchronization licenses of cover versions of Compositions that were initially procured during the Administration Term), you hereby grant Company the exclusive right to continue its collection and administration rights for an extended retention period with respect to the applicable Composition for three (3) years from the end of the Administration Term.</li></ol></li><li>MISCELLANEOUS.\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>At Company’s request, you shall execute and deliver to Company any documents needed regarding the rights of Company in the Compositions, and if you fail to do so within ten (10) business days following Company’s request thereof, Company may sign such documents in your name.</li><li>Concurrently with your execution of this amendment, you will supply Company with copies of any existing licenses or other agreements concerning the Compositions. You further agree to notify Company of each recorded version of any Composition during the Administration Term as soon as reasonably practicable after you become aware thereof. If and to the extent that you fail to provide to Company any of the materials and information referred to in this section 7(b), Company’s rights in and to the Compositions shall not be impaired as a result thereof. Company shall not be responsible for any non-collection of monies or lack of copyright protection with respect to the affected Composition(s) that is the direct or indirect result of any such failure by you.</li></ol></li></ol>"
