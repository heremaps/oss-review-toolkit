  "fulltext": "<p>The Clarified Artistic License</p><p>Preamble</p><p>The intent of this document is to state the conditions under which a <br>Package may be copied, such that the Copyright Holder maintains some <br>semblance of artistic control over the development of the package, <br>while giving the users of the package the right to use and distribute <br>the Package in a more-or-less customary fashion, plus the right to make <br>reasonable modifications.</p><p>Definitions:</p><p>\"Package\" refers to the collection of files distributed by the <br>Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection of files <br>created through textual modification.</p><p>\"Standard Version\" refers to such a Package if it has not been <br>modified, or has been modified in accordance with the wishes <br>of the Copyright Holder as specified below.</p><p>\"Copyright Holder\" is whoever is named in the copyright or <br>copyrights for the package.</p><p>\"You\" is you, if you're thinking about copying or distributing <br>this Package.</p><p>\"Distribution fee\" is a fee you charge for providing a copy <br>of this Package to another party.</p><p>\"Freely Available\" means that no fee is charged for the right to <br>use the item, though there may be fees involved in handling the <br>item. It also means that recipients of the item may redistribute <br>it under the same conditions they received it.</p><p>1. You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the <br>Standard Version of this Package without restriction, provided that you <br>duplicate all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.</p><p>2. You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications <br>derived from the Public Domain, or those made Freely Available, or from <br>the Copyright Holder. A Package modified in such a way shall still be <br>considered the Standard Version.</p><p>3. You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way, provided <br>that you insert a prominent notice in each changed file stating how and <br>when you changed that file, and provided that you do at least ONE of the <br>following:</p><p>a) place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise make them <br>Freely Available, such as by posting said modifications to Usenet or an <br>equivalent medium, or placing the modifications on a major network <br>archive site allowing unrestricted access to them, or by allowing the <br>Copyright Holder to include your modifications in the Standard Version <br>of the Package.</p><p>b) use the modified Package only within your corporation or organization.</p><p>c) rename any non-standard executables so the names do not conflict <br>with standard executables, which must also be provided, and provide <br>a separate manual page for each non-standard executable that clearly <br>documents how it differs from the Standard Version.</p><p>d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.</p><p>e) permit and encourge anyone who receives a copy of the modified Package <br>permission to make your modifications Freely Available <br>in some specific way.</p><p><br>4. You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code or <br>executable form, provided that you do at least ONE of the following:</p><p>a) distribute a Standard Version of the executables and library files, <br>together with instructions (in the manual page or equivalent) on where <br>to get the Standard Version.</p><p>b) accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source of <br>the Package with your modifications.</p><p>c) give non-standard executables non-standard names, and clearly <br>document the differences in manual pages (or equivalent), together <br>with instructions on where to get the Standard Version.</p><p>d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.</p><p>e) offer the machine-readable source of the Package, with your <br>modifications, by mail order.</p><p>5. You may charge a distribution fee for any distribution of this Package. <br>If you offer support for this Package, you may charge any fee you choose <br>for that support. You may not charge a license fee for the right to use <br>this Package itself. You may distribute this Package in aggregate with <br>other (possibly commercial and possibly nonfree) programs as part of a <br>larger (possibly commercial and possibly nonfree) software distribution, <br>and charge license fees for other parts of that software distribution, <br>provided that you do not advertise this Package as a product of your own. <br>If the Package includes an interpreter, You may embed this Package's <br>interpreter within an executable of yours (by linking); this shall be <br>construed as a mere form of aggregation, provided that the complete <br>Standard Version of the interpreter is so embedded.</p><p>6. The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced as <br>output from the programs of this Package do not automatically fall <br>under the copyright of this Package, but belong to whoever generated <br>them, and may be sold commercially, and may be aggregated with this <br>Package. If such scripts or library files are aggregated with this <br>Package via the so-called \"undump\" or \"unexec\" methods of producing a <br>binary executable image, then distribution of such an image shall <br>neither be construed as a distribution of this Package nor shall it <br>fall under the restrictions of Paragraphs 3 and 4, provided that you do <br>not represent such an executable image as a Standard Version of this <br>Package.</p><p>7. C subroutines (or comparably compiled subroutines in other <br>languages) supplied by you and linked into this Package in order to <br>emulate subroutines and variables of the language defined by this <br>Package shall not be considered part of this Package, but are the <br>equivalent of input as in Paragraph 6, provided these subroutines do <br>not change the language in any way that would cause it to fail the <br>regression tests for the language.</p><p>8. Aggregation of the Standard Version of the Package with a commercial <br>distribution is always permitted provided that the use of this Package <br>is embedded; that is, when no overt attempt is made to make this Package's <br>interfaces visible to the end user of the commercial distribution. <br>Such use shall not be construed as a distribution of this Package.</p><p>9. The name of the Copyright Holder may not be used to endorse or promote <br>products derived from this software without specific prior written permission.</p><p>10. THIS PACKAGE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\" AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR <br>IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED <br>WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.</p><p>The End</p>"
