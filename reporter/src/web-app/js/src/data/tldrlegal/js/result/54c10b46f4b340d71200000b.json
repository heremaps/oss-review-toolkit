  "fulltext": "<p>Microsoft Windows Insider Program</p><p>Program Agreement</p><p>Posted:  January 2015; Effective:  January 2015</p><p>IF YOU LIVE IN ( OR IF A BUSINESS, YOUR PRINCIPLE PLACE OF BUSINESS IS IN) THE UNITED STATES, SECTION 14 CONTAINS A BINDING ARBITRATION CLAUSE AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER. IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS ABOUT HOW TO RESOLVE ANY DISPUTE WITH MICROSOFT. PLEASE READ IT.</p><p>Thank you for choosing to participate in the Program! The purpose of the Program is to:</p><p>1.          provide participants with access to (i) experimental and prerelease software and services to try out on their devices, (ii) Content, (iii) Communications Services, and other related materials and interactions (collectively the “Program Services”); and</p><p>2.          provide Microsoft with feedback and detailed usage data about all activities occurring on those devices and interactions between the devices and Program Services so that Microsoft and its partners can improve their products and services.</p><p>This is an Agreement between you and Microsoft Corporation (or, based on where you live, or if a business, where your principal place of business is located, one of its affiliates) and governs your use of the Program Services. Please review the entire Agreement because all of the terms are important and together create a legal Agreement that, once accepted by you, applies to you. If you are entering into this Agreement on behalf of an entity, such as your employer, you represent that you have the legal authority to bind that entity. If you specify a company name in connection with signing up for the Program Services, you will be deemed to have entered into this Agreement on behalf of that organization or company.</p><p>IMPORTANT NOTICE</p><p>The Program Services include experimental and early prerelease software. This means that you may experience occasional crashes and data loss. To recover, you may have to reinstall your applications, the operating system, or re-flash your device. In some instances, once you install the Program Services software, you may not be able to go back to the prior version of the software. Additionally, the Program Services, if installed on a mobile device, may inadvertently damage your device rendering it inoperable. Using the Program Services on some devices may impact your warranty (check with your device provider). By participating, you agree to frequently backup your data.</p><p>The Program Services may:</p><p>          automatically collect and transmit data to Microsoft and its partners regarding activities on your devices, including personal information (see Privacy Statement for details http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=400912 and for Office apps included with the software see the Privacy Statement at http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=507380 );</p><p>          not be stable or tested to the same level as commercially-released software;</p><p>          stop working, be updated, or removed from your device automatically without notice. The Program Services update automatically, for example, through Windows Update. Automatic updating cannot be turned off. Some features may be removed or may stop working after a predetermined time period or at the end of an evaluation cycle once enough data has been collected. Some third party applications installed on the device may also not work, may stop working, or may be automatically deleted by the Program Services; and</p><p>          change before commercial release or may never be commercially released.</p><p>1.         Scope of Agreement; Changes; Minors</p><p>1.1    Agreement. The Agreement governs your use of the Program Services and consists of the notices and warnings above, these terms, terms incorporated by reference, and the Privacy Statements ( http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=400912 and for Office apps included with the software see http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=507380 ) (together, the “Agreement”). Additional terms may be applicable to software, supplements, updates, and other Microsoft web sites and services that you use and are necessary to use the Program Services, including the terms governing your Microsoft account, the Microsoft Services Agreement ( http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=246338 ).

You understand that by using the Program Services, you ratify this Agreement and the linked terms.</p><p>1.2    Changes to Agreement. From time to time, Microsoft may change or amend these terms. If we do, we will notify you, either by posting a notice on the Program Website ( http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=400983 ), through the user interface of the Software, in an email notification, instant message, or through other reasonable means. You agree to visit the Program Website at least once every 30 days to check for potential notice of changes. Your use of the Program Services after the date the change becomes effective will be your consent to the changed terms. If you do not agree to the changes, you must stop using the Program Services and follow the termination instructions in section 10. Otherwise, the new terms will apply to you.</p><p>1.3 Minors. By using the Program Services, you represent you have either reached the age of “majority” where you live or have valid parent or legal guardian consent to be bound by the terms of this Agreement and participate in the Program. If you don't know whether you have reached the age of majority where you live, or don't understand this section, please don't use the Program Services before you have asked your parent or legal guardian. If you are the parent or legal guardian of a minor and you are setting up access to the Program Services for a minor, you accept this Agreement on the minor’s behalf and are responsible for all use of the Program Services. Some or all Program Services may not be available for minors.</p><p>2.      Pre-Release Nature, Updates, and Support</p><p>2.1    Prerelease and Experimental Software and Services. The Program Services may have reduced or different security, privacy, accessibility, availability, and reliability standards relative to commercially provided services and software. We may change or discontinue the Program Services at any time without notice.</p><p>2.2 Updates. The Program Services update automatically, for example, through Windows Update, which cannot be turned off. By using the Program Services, you agree to receive automatic updates without any additional notice, and permit Microsoft to download and install them for you. You agree to obtain these updates only from Microsoft or Microsoft authorized sources .</p><p>2.3 Support. Limited or no support may be provided for the Program Services. Once you install the Software on your device, you may be voiding your device warranty and may not be entitled to support from the manufacturer of your device or network operator, if applicable.</p><p>3.      Privacy and Protection of Personal Information</p><p>You agree that Microsoft may collect, use and disclose your information as described in the Privacy Statements ( http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=400912 and for Office apps included with the software see http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=507380 ).</p><p>4.      Software</p><p>4.1 Microsoft may provide you with software (including any fonts, icons, images, or sound files included with the software, and also including updates, supplements, and upgrades) through or as a part of the Program Services (collectively “Software”). Software includes Windows apps which are apps developed by Microsoft that provide functionality such as mail, calendar, contacts, and news that are included with and are a part of Windows. You may install and test any number of copies of the Software on your devices as detailed in section 4 until the Software’s expiration date. Termination of use or access to the Program Services, or the termination of this Agreement, terminates your right to possess or use any such Software. Upon termination, follow the termination instructions in section 10.</p><p>Software is licensed under the terms of this Agreement, but it may also include additional license terms. To the extent those additional terms conflict with this Agreement, this Agreement will control.</p><p>Some or all of the Software may cease working on its expiration date. You have no right to use the Software after its expiration date. Starting from the expiration date, you may not be able to access any data used with the Software. Some applications and content you receive through the Store may also cease to be available to you for use with this Software; you may not receive any other notice. The Software may require a key to install or access it. If it does, you are responsible for the use of keys assigned to you. You should not share the keys with third parties.</p><p>4.2    Scope of Rights. All Software provided is the copyrighted work of Microsoft or its suppliers and is licensed to you, not sold. Microsoft reserves all rights (such as rights under intellectual property laws) not expressly granted in this agreement. In particular, this Agreement does not give you any right to, and you may not:</p><p>                                  i.             use the Software in a live operating environment;</p><p>                                 ii.             disclose the results of any benchmark tests of the Software to any third party without Microsoft’s prior written approval;</p><p>                               iii.             use or virtualize features of the Software separately;</p><p>                                iv.             publish, copy, rent, lease, transfer, or lend the Software;</p><p>                                 v.             attempt to circumvent technical protection measures in the Software, reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the Software, except if the laws where you live (or, if a business, where your principal place of business is located) permit this even when our Agreement does not. In that case, you may do only what your law allows; and</p><p>                                vi.             when using Internet-based features, you may not use those features in any way that could interfere with anyone else’s use of them, or to try to gain access to any service, data, account or network, in an unauthorized manner.</p><p>4.3    Open Source and Third Party Software.</p><p>                              i.                 The Software may include third party programs that Microsoft, not the third party, licenses to you under this Agreement. Notices, if any, for these third party programs are provided for your information only.</p><p>                             ii.                 If any software provided by Microsoft with a Program Service contains a copyright notice or similar indication of ownership that indicates it is owned by someone other than Microsoft, and it includes its own license agreement (e.g., Adobe Flash Player, see section 16.5), then that software is licensed to you by the third party and not Microsoft. Microsoft does not grant you any licenses or rights (express or implied) to the third party software.</p><p>                           iii.                 You are solely responsible for any third party software that you install, connect, or use with any Program Service. We will not run or make any copies of third party software outside of our relationship with you. You may only install or use third party software in a way that does not subject our intellectual property or technology to any terms governing the third party software. We are not a party to and are not bound by any terms governing your use of any third party software. Microsoft does not grant any licenses or rights (express or implied) to such third party software.</p><p>5.      Content</p><p>All documentation, images, Program Website web pages and other content provided in connection with the Program (collectively “Content”) are the copyrighted works of Microsoft or its suppliers. Use of the Content is governed by the terms of the license agreement, if any, that accompanies or is included with the Content. If no license agreement accompanies or is included with the Content, then your use of the Content is governed by this Agreement.</p><p>If any Content is made available to you in connection with the Program Services without a license agreement, then you may make a reasonable number of copies of the Content for your internal use in support of your participation in the Program Services. You must preserve the copyright notice in all copies of the Content and ensure that both the copyright notice and this permission notice appear in those copies. Except as provided in this section, no portion of the Content may be copied, imitated, published, transmitted, broadcast, or distributed, in whole or in part.</p><p>6.      Confidentiality</p><p>The Program Services are confidential information of Microsoft unless stated otherwise. If you or the entity you represent have an NDA with Microsoft, then the terms of that NDA govern your confidentiality obligations with respect to this confidential information. If no NDA exists between the parties, you agree that for a period of five years from the time you accessed this confidential information, you may not disclose this confidential information to any third party. You agree to only use this confidential information for the purpose of the Program as defined above. You agree not to misuse this confidential information, e.g., by using it to create a competitive product. These restrictions will not apply to any information that is or becomes publicly available without a breach of this restriction, was lawfully known to the receiver of the information without an obligation to keep it confidential, is received from another source who can disclose it lawfully and without an obligation to keep it confidential, or is independently developed. You may disclose this confidential information if required to comply with a court order or other government demand that has the force of law. Before doing so, you must seek the highest level of protection available and, when possible, give Microsoft enough prior notice to provide a reasonable chance to seek a protective order.</p><p>7.      Disclaimer of Warranties</p><p>MICROSOFT AND ITS RESPECTIVE SUPPLIERS PROVIDE THE PROGRAM SERVICES “AS IS,” “WITH ALL FAULTS,” AND “AS AVAILABLE.” YOU BEAR THE RISK OF USING IT. MICROSOFT GIVES NO EXPRESS WARRANTIES, GUARANTEES, OR CONDITIONS. YOU MAY HAVE ADDITIONAL CONSUMER RIGHTS UNDER YOUR LOCAL LAWS WHICH THIS AGREEMENT CANNOT CHANGE. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER YOUR LOCAL LAWS, MICROSOFT EXCLUDES THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. For Australia only: You have statutory guarantees under the Australian Consumer Law and nothing in these terms is intended to affect those rights.</p><p>MICROSOFT DOES NOT CONTROL, REVIEW, REVISE, ENDORSE, OR ACCEPT RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY THIRD PARTY CONTENT, INFORMATION, MESSAGES, MATERIALS, OR PROJECTS ACCESSIBLE FROM OR LINKED THROUGH THE PROGRAM SERVICES, AND, EXCEPT AS WARRANTED IN A SEPARATE AGREEMENT, MICROSOFT MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES WHATSOEVER ABOUT AND SHALL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY OF THE FOREGOING. ANY DEALINGS YOU MAY HAVE WITH SUCH THIRD PARTIES ARE AT YOUR OWN RISK.</p><p>IN NO EVENT SHALL MICROSOFT OR ITS SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL, INDIRECT, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OR ANY DAMAGES WHATSOEVER RESULTING FROM LOSS OF USE, DATA, OR PROFITS, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, NEGLIGENCE, OR OTHER TORTIOUS ACTION, ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE USE OR PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM SERVICES, CONTENT, PROVISION OF OR FAILURE TO PROVIDE SERVICES, OR INFORMATION AVAILABLE FROM THE PROGRAM SERVICES.</p><p>If you have any basis for recovering damages from Microsoft related to the Software, you can recover only direct damages up to the amount that you paid for the Software (or up to $5.00 USD if you acquired the Software for no charge). You may not recover any other damages, including consequential, lost profits, special, indirect, or incidental damages. The damage exclusions and limitations in this Agreement apply even if repair, replacement, or a refund for the Software does not fully compensate you for any losses or if Microsoft knew or should have known about the possibility of the damages. Some states and countries do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental, consequential, or other damages, so those limitations or exclusions may not apply to you. If your local law allows you to recover other damages from Microsoft even though we do not, you cannot recover more than you paid for the Software (or up to $5.00 USD if you acquired the Software for no charge).</p><p>8.      Reservation of Rights</p><p>Microsoft may have patents, patent applications, trademarks, copyrights, or other intellectual property rights covering subject matter in the Program Services.

You also give to third parties, without charge, any patent rights needed for their products, technologies, and services to use or interface with any specific parts of a Microsoft software or service that includes the Submission. You will not provide Submissions that are subject to a license that requires Microsoft to license its software or documentation to third parties because we include your Submission in them.

You must continue to comply with section 6 (Confidentiality) after termination of this Agreement. After termination, Microsoft may continue to use all Submissions and the data collected prior to termination.</p><p>11.    Prohibited Use of Program Services</p><p>As a condition of your use of Program Services, you will not use them for any purpose that is unlawful or prohibited by these terms, conditions, and notices.

ALL INQUIRIES NOT RELEVANT TO THE FOLLOWING PROCEDURE WILL NOT RECEIVE A RESPONSE. See Notice and Procedure for Making Claims of Copyright Infringement at http://www.microsoft.com/info/cpyrtInfrg.htm .</p><p>14.    BINDING ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER IF YOU LIVE IN (OR IF A BUSINESS YOUR PRINCIPLE PLACE OF BUSINESS IS IN) THE UNITED STATES</p><p>This section applies to any dispute EXCEPT DISPUTES RELATING TO THE ENFORCEMENT OR VALIDITY OF YOUR, MICROSOFT’S, OR EITHER OF OUR LICENSORS’ INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. The term “dispute” means any dispute, action, or other controversy between you and Microsoft concerning the Program Services (including their price) or this Agreement, whether in contract, warranty, tort, statute, regulation, ordinance, or any other legal or equitable basis. “Dispute” will be given the broadest possible meaning allowable under law.</p><p>14.1    N otice of Dispute. In the event of a dispute, you or Microsoft must give the other a Notice of Dispute, which is a written statement of the name, address, and contact information of the party giving it, the facts giving rise to the dispute, and the relief requested. You must send any Notice of Dispute by U.S. Mail to Microsoft Corporation, ATTN: LCA ARBITRATION, One Microsoft Way, Redmond, WA 98052-6399, U.S.A . A form is available at http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=245499 . Microsoft will send any Notice of Dispute to you by U.S. Mail to your address if we have it, or otherwise to your email address. You and Microsoft will attempt to resolve any dispute through informal negotiation within 60 days from the date the Notice of Dispute is sent. After 60 days, you or Microsoft may commence arbitration.</p><p>14.2    Small claims court. You may also bring any dispute in small claims court in your county of residence (or if a business, your principal place of business) or King County, Washington, U.S.A., if the dispute meets all requirements to be heard in the small claims court. You may sue in small claims court whether or not you negotiated informally first.</p><p>14.3    Binding arbitration.If you and Microsoft do not resolve any dispute by informal negotiation or in small claims court, any other effort to resolve the dispute will be conducted exclusively by individual binding arbitration governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”). Class arbitrations are not permitted. You are giving up the right to sue in court before a judge or jury (or participate in court as a party or class member). Instead, all disputes will be resolved before a neutral arbitrator, whose decision will be final except for a limited right of appeal under the FAA. Any court with jurisdiction over the parties may enforce the arbitrator’s award.</p><p>14.4    Class action waiver.Any proceedings to resolve any dispute in any forum will be conducted solely on an individual basis. Neither you nor Microsoft will seek to have any dispute heard as a class action, private attorney general action, or in any other proceeding in which either party acts or proposes to act in a representative capacity. No arbitration or other proceeding will be combined with another without the prior written consent of all parties to all affected arbitrations or proceedings.</p><p>14.5    Arbitration procedure. Any arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (the “AAA”) under its Commercial Arbitration Rules (or, if you are an individual and use the Program Services for personal or household use, or if the value of the dispute is $75,000 USD or less whether or not you are an individual or how you use the Program Services, its Consumer Arbitration Rules). For more information, see www.adr.org or call 1-800-778-7879. To commence arbitration, submit the form available at http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=245497 to the AAA. You agree to commence arbitration only in your county of residence (or, if a business, your principal place of business) or in King County, Washington, U.S.A. Microsoft agrees to commence arbitration only in your county of residence (or, if a business, your principal place of business). You may request a telephonic or in-person hearing by following the AAA rules. In a dispute involving $25,000 USD or less, any hearing will be telephonic unless the arbitrator finds good cause to hold an in-person hearing instead. The arbitrator may award the same damages to you individually as a court could. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only to you individually, and only to the extent required to satisfy your individual claim.</p><p>14.6    Arbitration fees and payments.</p><p>14.6.1   Disputes involving $75,000 USD or less. Microsoft will promptly reimburse your filing fees and pay the AAA’s and arbitrator’s fees and expenses. If you reject Microsoft’s last written settlement offer made before the arbitrator was appointed (“Microsoft’s last written offer”), your dispute goes all the way to an arbitrator’s decision (called an “award”), and the arbitrator awards you more than Microsoft’s last written offer, Microsoft will: (i) pay the greater of the award or $1,000 USD; (ii) pay your reasonable attorney’s fees, if any; and (iii) reimburse any expenses (including expert witness fees and costs) that your attorney reasonably accrues for investigating, preparing, and pursuing your claim in arbitration. The arbitrator will determine the amount of fees, costs, and expenses unless you and Microsoft agree on them.</p><p>14.6.2   Disputes involving more than $75,000 USD. The AAA rules will govern payment of filing fees and the AAA’s and arbitrator’s fees and expenses.</p><p>14.6.3   Disputes involving any amount. In any arbitration you commence, Microsoft will seek its AAA or arbitrator’s fees and expenses, or your filing fees it reimbursed, only if the arbitrator finds the arbitration frivolous or brought for an improper purpose. In any arbitration Microsoft commences, Microsoft will pay all filing, AAA, and arbitrator’s fees and expenses. Microsoft will not seek its attorney’s fees or expenses from you in any arbitration. Fees and expenses are not counted in determining how much a dispute involves.</p><p>14.7 Claims or disputes must be filed within one year. To the extent permitted by law, any claim or dispute to which section 14 applies must be filed within one year in small claims court (section 14.2), in arbitration (section 14.3), or in court, if section 14 permits the dispute to be filed in court instead of arbitration. The one-year period begins when the claim or dispute first could be filed. If such a claim or dispute is not filed within one year, it is permanently barred.</p><p>14.8    S everability. If the class action waiver in section 14.4 is found to be illegal or unenforceable as to all or some parts of a dispute, then section 14 will not apply to those parts.
