DISTRIBUTION OBLIGATIONS.</p><p>3.1 Application of License.</p><p><br>The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are governed <br>by the terms of this License, including without limitation Section 2.2. <br>The Source Code version of Covered Software may be distributed only under <br>the terms of this License or a future version of this License released <br>under Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of this License with every <br>copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose any <br>terms on any Source Code version that alters or restricts the applicable <br>version of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You <br>may include an additional document offering the additional rights described <br>in Section 3.5.</p><p>3.2 Availability of Source Code.</p><p>Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be <br>made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License either <br>on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted Electronic <br>Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable version <br>available; and if made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism, <br>must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it <br>initially became available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent <br>version of that particular Modification has been made available to such <br>recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version <br>remains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained <br>by a third party.</p><p>3.3 Description of Modifications.</p><p>You must cause all Covered Software to which You contribute to contain <br>a file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Software <br>and the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that <br>the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Software <br>provided by Nokia and including the name of Nokia in (a) the Source Code, <br>and (b) in any notice in an Executable version or related documentation <br>in which You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Software.</p><p>3.4 Intellectual Property Matters</p><p>(a) Third Party Claims.</p><p>If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's intellectual <br>property rights is required to exercise the rights granted by such Contributor <br>under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor must include a text file with the <br>Source Code distribution titled \"LEGAL'' which describes the claim and <br>the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know <br>whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after the Modification <br>is made available as described in Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly <br>modify the LEGAL file in all copies Contributor makes available thereafter <br>and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists <br>or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered <br>Software that new knowledge has been obtained.</p><p>(b) Contributor APIs.</p><p>If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming interface <br>and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which are reasonably necessary <br>to implement that API, Contributor must also include this information in <br>the LEGAL file.</p><p>(c) Representations.</p><p>Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section <br>3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's Modifications are <br>Contributor's original creation(s) and/or Contributor has sufficient rights <br>to grant the rights conveyed by this License.</p><p>3.5 Required Notices.</p><p>You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source <br>Code. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code <br>file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a location <br>(such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely to look for <br>such a notice. If You created one or more Modification(s) You may add your <br>name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. You must also <br>duplicate this License in any documentation for the Source Code where You <br>describe recipients' rights or ownership rights relating to Covered Software. <br>You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity <br>or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software. <br>However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of Nokia <br>or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, <br>support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and <br>You hereby agree to indemnify Nokia and every Contributor for any liability <br>incurred by Nokia or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, <br>indemnity or liability terms You offer.</p><p>3.6 Distribution of Executable Versions.</p><p>You may distribute Covered Software in Executable form only if the <br>requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Software, <br>and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of the <br>Covered Software is available under the terms of this License, including <br>a description of how and where You have fulfilled the obligations of Section <br>3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable <br>version, related documentation or collateral in which You describe recipients' <br>rights relating to the Covered Software. You may distribute the Executable <br>version of Covered Software or ownership rights under a license of Your <br>choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided that <br>You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license <br>for the Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's <br>rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this License. <br>If You distribute the Executable version under a different license You <br>must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License <br>are offered by You alone, not by Nokia or any Contributor. You hereby agree <br>to indemnify Nokia and every Contributor for any liability incurred by <br>Nokia or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.</p><p>3.7 Larger Works.</p><p>You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software with other <br>software not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger <br>Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements <br>of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Software.</p><p>4. INABILITY TO COMPLY DUE TO STATUTE OR REGULATION.</p><p>If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this <br>License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, <br>judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms <br>of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations <br>and the code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL <br>file described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions <br>of the Source Code.</p><p>Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description <br>must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able <br>to understand it.</p><p>5. APPLICATION OF THIS LICENSE.</p><p>This License applies to code to which Nokia has attached the notice <br>in Exhibit A and to related Covered Software.</p><p>6. VERSIONS OF THE LICENSE.</p><p><br>6.1 New Versions.</p><p>Nokia may publish revised and/or new versions of the License from time <br>to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.</p><p>6.2 Effect of New Versions.</p><p>Once Covered Software has been published under a particular version <br>of the License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that <br>version. You may also choose to use such Covered Software under the terms <br>of any subsequent version of the License published by Nokia. No one other <br>than Nokia has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Software <br>created under this License.</p><p>7.

LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.</p><p>UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING <br>NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, NOKIA, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, <br>OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH <br>PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, <br>OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, <br>DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, <br>OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL <br>HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
