(You will not be required to justify it to the <br>Copyright Holder, but only to the computing community at large <br>as a market that must bear the fee.)</p><p>\"Freely Available\" means that no fee is charged for the item <br>itself, though there may be fees involved in handling the item. <br>It also means that recipients of the item may redistribute it <br>under the same conditions they received it.</p><p>1. You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the <br>Standard Version of this Package without restriction, provided that you <br>duplicate all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.</p><p>2. You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications <br>derived from the Public Domain or from the Copyright Holder. A Package <br>modified in such a way shall still be considered the Standard Version.</p><p>3. You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way, provided <br>that you insert a prominent notice in each changed file stating how and <br>when you changed that file, and provided that you do at least ONE of the <br>following:</p><p>a) place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise make them <br>Freely Available, such as by posting said modifications to Usenet or <br>an equivalent medium, or placing the modifications on a major archive <br>site such as uunet.uu.net, or by allowing the Copyright Holder to include <br>your modifications in the Standard Version of the Package.</p><p>b) use the modified Package only within your corporation or organization.</p><p>c) rename any non-standard executables so the names do not conflict <br>with standard executables, which must also be provided, and provide <br>a separate manual page for each non-standard executable that clearly <br>documents how it differs from the Standard Version.</p><p>d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.</p><p>4. You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code or <br>executable form, provided that you do at least ONE of the following:</p><p>a) distribute a Standard Version of the executables and library files, <br>together with instructions (in the manual page or equivalent) on where <br>to get the Standard Version.</p><p>b) accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source of <br>the Package with your modifications.</p><p>c) accompany any non-standard executables with their corresponding <br>Standard Version executables, giving the non-standard executables <br>non-standard names, and clearly documenting the differences in manual <br>pages (or equivalent), together with instructions on where to get <br>the Standard Version.</p><p>d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.</p><p>5. You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution of this <br>Package. You may charge any fee you choose for support of this Package. <br>You may not charge a fee for this Package itself. However, <br>you may distribute this Package in aggregate with other (possibly <br>commercial) programs as part of a larger (possibly commercial) software <br>distribution provided that you do not advertise this Package as a <br>product of your own.</p><p>6. The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced as <br>output from the programs of this Package do not automatically fall <br>under the copyright of this Package, but belong to whomever generated <br>them, and may be sold commercially, and may be aggregated with this <br>Package.</p><p>7. C subroutines supplied by you and linked into this Package in order <br>to emulate subroutines and variables of the language defined by this <br>Package shall not be considered part of this Package, but are the <br>equivalent of input as in Paragraph 6, provided these subroutines do <br>not change the language in any way that would cause it to fail the <br>regression tests for the language.</p><p>8.
