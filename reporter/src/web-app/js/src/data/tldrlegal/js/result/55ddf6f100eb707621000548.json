If you are agreeing to this Agreement not as an individual but on behalf of your company, then “<strong>Customer</strong>” or “<strong>you</strong>”\r\n means your company, and you are binding your company to this Agreement.\r\n Atlassian may modify this Agreement from time to time, subject to the \r\nterms in Section 26 (Changes to this Agreement) below.</p><p><strong><em>By\r\n clicking on the “I agree” (or similar button) that is presented to you \r\nat the time of your Order, or by using or accessing Atlassian products, \r\nyou indicate your assent to be bound by this Agreement.</em></strong></p><p><strong>1 Scope of the Agreement.</strong> This Agreement governs \r\nyour initial purchase as well as any future purchases made by you that \r\nreference this Agreement. This Agreement includes our <a href=\"https://www.atlassian.com/company/privacy\">Privacy Policy</a>, our <a href=\"https://www.atlassian.com/legal/acceptable-use-policy\">Acceptable Use Policy</a>,\r\n any Orders, and any other referenced policies and attachments. This \r\nAgreement applies to Atlassian add-ons or plugins that you purchase from\r\n the <a href=\"https://marketplace.atlassian.com/\">Atlassian Marketplace</a>. However, it does not apply to add-ons or plugins from other vendors on the Atlassian Marketplace, which are covered under the <a href=\"https://www.atlassian.com/licensing/marketplace/termsofuse\">Atlassian Marketplace Terms of Use</a>.</p> <p><strong>2 Types of Atlassian Products.</strong>\r\n This Agreement governs (a) Atlassian’s commercially available \r\ndownloadable software products (currently designated as \"Server\" or \r\n\"Data Center\" deployments) (“<strong>Software</strong>”), (b) Atlassian’s hosted or cloud-based solutions (currently designated as \"Cloud\" deployments) (“<strong>Hosted Services</strong>”),\r\n and (c) any related support or maintenance services provided by \r\nAtlassian. Software and Hosted Services, together with related \r\nDocumentation, are referred to as “<strong>Products</strong>”. The Products and their permitted use are further described in Atlassian’s standard documentation (“<strong>Documentation</strong>”).\r\n Section 6 (Software Terms) applies specifically to Software, and \r\nSection 7 (Hosted Services Terms) applies specifically to Hosted \r\nServices, but unless otherwise specified, other provisions of this \r\nAgreement apply to all Products.</p> <p><strong>3 Account Registration.</strong>\r\n You may need to register for an Atlassian account in order to place \r\norders or access or receive any Products. Any registration information \r\nthat you provide to us must be accurate, current and complete. You must \r\nalso update your information so that we may send notices, statements and\r\n other information to you by email or through your account. You are \r\nresponsible for all actions taken through your accounts.</p> <p><strong>4 Orders.</strong></p> <p><strong>4.1 Directly with Atlassian.</strong> Atlassian’s Product ordering documentation or purchase flow (“<strong>Order</strong>”)\r\n will specify your authorized scope of use for the Products, which may \r\ninclude: (a) number and type of Authorized Users (as defined below), (b)\r\n storage or capacity (for Hosted Services), (c) numbers of licenses, \r\ncopies or instances (for Software), or (d) other restrictions or \r\nbillable units (as applicable, the “<strong>Scope of Use</strong>”). The term “<strong>Order</strong>”\r\n also includes any applicable Product or Support and Maintenance \r\nrenewal, or purchases you make to increase or upgrade your Scope of Use.</p> <p><strong>4.2 Reseller Orders.</strong>\r\n This Agreement applies whether you purchase our Products directly from \r\nAtlassian or through Atlassian “Experts” or other authorized resellers \r\n(each, a “<strong>Reseller</strong>”). If you purchase through a \r\nReseller, your Scope of Use shall be as stated in the Order placed by \r\nReseller for you, and Reseller is responsible for the accuracy of any \r\nsuch Order. Resellers are not authorized to make any promises or \r\ncommitments on Atlassian’s behalf, and we are not bound by any \r\nobligations to you other than what we specify in this Agreement.</p> <p><strong>5 Authorized Users.</strong> Only the specific individuals for whom you have paid the required fees and whom you designate through the applicable Product (“<strong>Authorized Users</strong>”)\r\n may access and use the Products. Some Products may allow you to \r\ndesignate different types of Authorized Users, in which case pricing and\r\n functionality may vary according to the type of Authorized User. \r\nAuthorized Users may be your or your Affiliates’ employees, \r\nrepresentatives, consultants, contractors, agents, or other third \r\nparties who are acting for your benefit or on your behalf. You may also \r\npermit your customers to have limited access to certain Products as \r\nAuthorized Users, subject to the terms of our <a href=\"https://www.atlassian.com/legal/customer-use-addendum\">Customer Use Addendum</a>.\r\n You may increase the number of Authorized Users permitted to access \r\nyour instance of the Product by placing a new Order or, in some cases, \r\ndirectly through the Product. In all cases, you must pay the applicable \r\nfee for the increased number of Authorized Users. You are responsible \r\nfor compliance with this Agreement by all Authorized Users. All use of \r\nProducts by you and your Authorized Users must be within the Scope of \r\nUse and solely for the benefit of you or your Affiliates. “<strong>Affiliate</strong>”\r\n means an entity which, directly or indirectly, owns or controls, is \r\nowned or is controlled by or is under common ownership or control with a\r\n party, where “control” means the power to direct the management or \r\naffairs of an entity, and “ownership” means the beneficial ownership of \r\n50% (or, if the applicable jurisdiction does not allow majority \r\nownership, the maximum amount permitted under such law) or more of the \r\nvoting equity securities or other equivalent voting interests of the \r\nentity.</p> <p><strong>6 Software Terms.</strong></p> <p><strong>6.1 Your License Rights.</strong>\r\n Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Atlassian grants\r\n you a non-exclusive, non-sublicenseable and non-transferable license to\r\n install and use the Software during the applicable License Term in \r\naccordance with this Agreement, your applicable Scope of Use, and the \r\nDocumentation. The term of each Software license (“<strong>License Term</strong>”)\r\n will be specified in your Order. Your License Term will end upon any \r\ntermination of this Agreement, even if it is identified as “perpetual” \r\nor if no expiration date is specified in your Order. The Software \r\nrequires a license key in order to operate, which will be delivered as \r\ndescribed in Section 10.2 (Delivery).</p> <p><strong>6.2 Number of Instances.</strong>\r\n Unless otherwise specified in your Order, for each Software license \r\nthat you purchase, you may install one production instance of the \r\nSoftware on systems owned or operated by you (or your third party \r\nservice providers so long as you remain responsible for their compliance\r\n with the terms and conditions of this Agreement). We also make \r\navailable “developer” licenses free of charge for certain of our \r\nSoftware offerings to allow you to deploy non-production instances, such\r\n as for staging or QA purposes. Details for how to request \r\nnon-production licenses are available on our website.</p> <p><strong>6.3 Your Modifications.</strong>\r\n Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement (including \r\nwithout limitation Section 2 (Combining the Products with Open Source \r\nSoftware) of <a href=\"https://www.atlassian.com/legal/third-party-code\">Third Party Code in Atlassian Products</a>):\r\n (1) for any elements of the Software provided by Atlassian in source \r\ncode form, and to the extent permitted in the Documentation, you may \r\nmodify such source code solely for purposes of developing bug fixes, \r\ncustomizations and additional features for the Software and (2) you may \r\nalso modify the Documentation to reflect your permitted modifications of\r\n the Software source code or the particular use of the Products within \r\nyour organization. Any modified source code or Documentation constitutes\r\n “<strong>Your Modifications</strong>”. You may use Your Modifications \r\nsolely with respect to your own instances in support of your permitted \r\nuse of the Software but you may not distribute the code to Your \r\nModifications to any third party. Notwithstanding anything in this \r\nAgreement to the contrary, Atlassian has no support, warranty, \r\nindemnification or other obligation or liability with respect to Your \r\nModifications or their combination, interaction or use with our \r\nProducts. You shall indemnify, defend and hold us harmless from and \r\nagainst any and all claims, costs, damages, losses, liabilities and \r\nexpenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs) arising out of\r\n or in connection with any claim brought against us by a third party \r\nrelating to Your Modifications (including but not limited to any \r\nrepresentations or warranties you make about Your Modifications or the \r\nSoftware) or your breach of this Section 6.3. This indemnification \r\nobligation is subject to your receiving (i) prompt written notice of \r\nsuch claim (but in any event notice in sufficient time for you to \r\nrespond without prejudice); (ii) the exclusive right to control and \r\ndirect the investigation, defense, or settlement of such claim; and \r\n(iii) all reasonably necessary cooperation of Atlassian at your expense.</p> <p><strong>6.4 Attribution.</strong>\r\n In any use of the Software, you must include the following attribution \r\nto Atlassian on all user interfaces in the following format: “Powered by\r\n Atlassian,” which must in every case include a hyperlink to \r\nhttp://www.atlassian.com, and which must be in the same format as \r\ndelivered in the Software.</p> <p><strong>6.5 Third Party Code. </strong> The Software includes code and libraries licensed to us by third parties, including open source software. See <a href=\"https://www.atlassian.com/legal/third-party-code\">Third Party Code in Atlassian Products</a> for additional provisions regarding our use of third party code.</p> <p><strong>7 Hosted Services Terms.</strong></p> <p><strong>7.1 Access to Hosted Services.</strong>\r\n Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Atlassian grants\r\n you a non-exclusive right to access and use the Hosted Services during \r\nthe applicable Subscription Term (as defined below) in accordance with \r\nthis Agreement, your applicable Scope of Use and the Documentation. If \r\nAtlassian offers client software (e.g., a desktop or mobile application)\r\n for any Hosted Service, you may use such software solely with the \r\nHosted Service, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement. \r\nYou acknowledge that our Hosted Services are on-line, subscription-based\r\n products and that we may make changes to the Hosted Services from time \r\nto time.</p> <p><strong>7.2 Subscription Terms and Renewals.</strong> Hosted Services are provided on a subscription basis for a set term specified in your Order (“<strong>Subscription Term</strong>”).\r\n Except as otherwise specified in your Order, all subscriptions will \r\nautomatically renew for periods equal to your initial Subscription Term \r\n(and you will be charged at the then-current rates) unless you cancel \r\nyour subscription through your account at my.atlassian.com. If you \r\ncancel, your subscription will terminate at the end of then-current \r\nbilling cycle, but you will not be entitled to any credits or refunds \r\nfor amounts accrued or paid prior to such termination.</p> <p><strong>7.3 Credentials.</strong>\r\n You must ensure that all Authorized Users keep their user IDs and \r\npasswords for the Hosted Services strictly confidential and not share \r\nsuch information with any unauthorized person. User IDs are granted to \r\nindividual, named persons and may not be shared. You are responsible for\r\n any and all actions taken using your accounts and passwords, and you \r\nagree to immediately notify Atlassian of any unauthorized use of which \r\nyou become aware.</p> <p><strong>7.4 Your Data.</strong> “<strong>Your Data</strong>”\r\n means any data, content, code, video, images or other materials of any \r\ntype that you upload, submit or otherwise transmit to or through Hosted \r\nServices. You will retain all right, title and interest in and to Your \r\nData in the form provided to Atlassian. Subject to the terms of this \r\nAgreement, you hereby grant to Atlassian a non-exclusive, worldwide, \r\nroyalty-free right to (a) collect, use, copy, store, transmit, modify \r\nand create derivative works of Your Data, in each case solely to the \r\nextent necessary to provide the applicable Hosted Service to you and (b)\r\n for Hosted Services that enable you to share Your Data or interact with\r\n other people, to distribute and publicly perform and display Your Data \r\nas you (or your Authorized Users) direct or enable through the Hosted \r\nService. Atlassian may also access your account or instance in order to \r\nrespond to your support requests.</p> <p><strong>7.5 Security.</strong> \r\nAtlassian implements security procedures to help protect Your Data from \r\nsecurity attacks. However, you understand that use of the Hosted \r\nServices necessarily involves transmission of Your Data over networks \r\nthat are not owned, operated or controlled by us, and we are not \r\nresponsible for any of Your Data lost, altered, intercepted or stored \r\nacross such networks. We cannot guarantee that our security procedures \r\nwill be error-free, that transmissions of Your Data will always be \r\nsecure or that unauthorized third parties will never be able to defeat \r\nour security measures or those of our third party service providers.</p> <p><strong>7.6 Storage Limits.</strong>\r\n There may be storage limits associated with a particular Hosted \r\nService. These limits are described in the services descriptions on our \r\nwebsites or in the Documentation for the particular Hosted Service. \r\nAtlassian reserves the right to charge for additional storage or overage\r\n fees at the rates specified on our website. We may impose new, or may \r\nmodify existing, storage limits for the Hosted Services at any time in \r\nour discretion, with or without notice to you.</p> <p><strong>7.7 Responsibility for Your Data.</strong></p> <p><strong>7.7.1 General.</strong> You must ensure that your use of Hosted Services and all Your Data is at all times compliant with our <a href=\"https://www.atlassian.com/legal/acceptable-use-policy\">Acceptable Use Policy</a> and all applicable local, state, federal and international laws and regulations (“<strong>Laws</strong>”).\r\n You represent and warrant that: (i) you have obtained all necessary \r\nrights, releases and permissions to provide all Your Data to Atlassian \r\nand to grant the rights granted to Atlassian in this Agreement and (ii) \r\nYour Data and its transfer to and use by Atlassian as authorized by you \r\nunder this Agreement do not violate any Laws (including without \r\nlimitation those relating to export control and electronic \r\ncommunications) or rights of any third party, including without \r\nlimitation any intellectual property rights, rights of privacy, or \r\nrights of publicity, and any use, collection and disclosure authorized \r\nherein is not inconsistent with the terms of any applicable privacy \r\npolicies. Other than its security obligations under Section 7.5 \r\n(Security), Atlassian assumes no responsibility or liability for Your \r\nData, and you shall be solely responsible for Your Data and the \r\nconsequences of using, disclosing, storing, or transmitting it.</p> <p><strong>7.7.2 Sensitive Data.</strong>\r\n You will not submit to the Hosted Services (or use the Hosted Services \r\nto collect): (i) any personally identifiable information, except as \r\nnecessary for the establishment of your Atlassian account; (ii) any \r\npatient, medical or other protected health information regulated by \r\nHIPAA or any similar federal or state laws, rules or regulations; or \r\n(iii) any other information subject to regulation or protection under \r\nspecific laws such as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (or related rules or \r\nregulations) ((i) through (iii), collectively, “<strong>Sensitive Data</strong>”).\r\n You also acknowledge that Atlassian is not acting as your Business \r\nAssociate or subcontractor (as such terms are defined and used in HIPAA)\r\n and that the Hosted Services are not HIPAA compliant. “<strong>HIPAA</strong>”\r\n means the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, as \r\namended and supplemented. Notwithstanding any other provision to the \r\ncontrary, Atlassian has no liability under this Agreement for Sensitive \r\nData.</p> <p><strong>7.7.3 Indemnity for Your Data</strong><strong>.</strong>\r\n You will defend, indemnify and hold harmless Atlassian from and against\r\n any loss, cost, liability or damage, including attorneys’ fees, for \r\nwhich Atlassian becomes liable arising from or relating to any claim \r\nrelating to Your Data, including but not limited to any claim brought by\r\n a third party alleging that Your Data, or your use of the Hosted \r\nServices in breach of this Agreement, infringes or misappropriates the \r\nintellectual property rights of a third party or violates applicable \r\nlaw. This indemnification obligation is subject to your receiving (i) \r\nprompt written notice of such claim (but in any event notice in \r\nsufficient time for you to respond without prejudice); (ii) the \r\nexclusive right to control and direct the investigation, defense, or \r\nsettlement of such claim; and (iii) all reasonable necessary cooperation\r\n of Atlassian at your expense.</p> <p><strong>7.8 Removals and Suspension.</strong>\r\n Atlassian has no obligation to monitor any content uploaded to the \r\nHosted Services. Nonetheless, if we deem such action necessary based on \r\nyour violation of this Agreement or in response to takedown requests \r\nthat we receive following our guidelines for <a href=\"https://www.atlassian.com/legal/copyright-and-trademark-violations\">Reporting Copyright and Trademark Violations</a>,\r\n we may (1) remove Your Data from the Hosted Services or (2) suspend \r\nyour access to the Hosted Services. We will generally alert you when we \r\ntake such action and give you a reasonable opportunity to cure your \r\nbreach, but if we determine that your actions endanger the operation of \r\nthe Hosted Service or other users, we may suspend your access \r\nimmediately without notice. You will continue to be charged for the \r\nHosted Service during any suspension period. We have no liability to you\r\n for removing or deleting Your Data from or suspending your access to \r\nany Hosted Services as described in this section.</p> <p><strong>7.9 Deletion at End of Subscription Term.</strong> We may remove or delete Your Data within a reasonable period of time after the termination of your Subscription Term.</p> <p><strong>7.10 Service-Specific Terms.</strong> Some of our Hosted Services may be subject to additional terms specific to that service as set forth in our <a href=\"https://www.atlassian.com/legal/service-specific-terms\">Service-Specific Terms</a>.</p> <p><strong>8 Support and Maintenance.</strong> Atlassian will provide the support and maintenance services for the Products described in the <a href=\"https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/Support/Atlassian+Support+Offerings\">Atlassian Support Policy</a> (“<strong>Support and Maintenance</strong>”)\r\n during the period for which you have paid the applicable fee. Support \r\nand Maintenance is subject to the terms of the Atlassian Support Policy \r\nand will be provided at the support level and during the support term \r\nspecified in your Order. The Atlassian Support Policy may be modified by\r\n Atlassian from time to time to reflect process improvements or changing\r\n practices. Support and Maintenance for Software includes access to New \r\nReleases, if and when available. You may use any New Releases that we \r\nprovide to you during a valid support term in the same way that you use \r\nSoftware, and New Releases are included in the definition of Software in\r\n that case. “<strong>New Releases</strong>” are bug fixes, patches, \r\nmajor or minor releases, or any other changes, enhancements, or \r\nmodifications to the Software that we make generally commercially \r\navailable.</p> <p><strong>9 TAM and Training Services.</strong> We will \r\nprovide Technical Account Manager (TAM) and training services purchased \r\nin an Order in accordance with the descriptions and conditions for those\r\n services set forth in the Order and the accompanying service \r\ndescriptions or datasheets (“<strong>Ancillary Services</strong>”). \r\nAtlassian shall retain all right, title and interest in and to any \r\nmaterials, deliverables, modifications, derivative works or developments\r\n related to any training services we provide (“<strong>Training Materials</strong>”).\r\n Any Training Materials provided to you may be used only in connection \r\nwith the Products subject to the same use restrictions for the Products.\r\n If applicable, you will reimburse Atlassian for reasonable travel and \r\nlodging expenses as incurred. TAM services are subject to the terms of \r\nthe <a href=\"https://www.atlassian.com/legal/services-agreement\">Atlassian Professional Services Agreement</a>.</p> <p><strong>10 Returns and Financial Terms.</strong></p> <p><strong>10.1 Return Policy.</strong>\r\n As part of our commitment to customer satisfaction, it is our customary\r\n business practice to allow customers to return a Product within 30 days\r\n of payment for any reason or no reason and to receive a refund of the \r\namount paid for the returned Product. In the context of Software, a \r\nreturn means that we will disable the license key that allowed the \r\nSoftware to operate. In the context of Hosted Services, a return means \r\nthat we will disable access to the Hosted Service. We will not accept \r\nreturns after the 30-day return period. You understand that Atlassian \r\nmay change this practice in the future in accordance with Section 26 \r\n(Changes to this Agreement).</p> <p><strong>10.2 Delivery. </strong>We \r\nwill deliver the applicable license keys (in the case of Software) or \r\nlogin instructions (in the case of Hosted Services) to the email \r\naddresses specified in your Order when we have received payment of the \r\napplicable fees. All deliveries under this Agreement will be electronic.\r\n For the avoidance of doubt, you are responsible for installation of any\r\n Software, and you acknowledge that Atlassian has no further delivery \r\nobligation with respect to the Software after delivery of the license \r\nkeys.</p> <p><strong>10.3 Payment.</strong> You agree to pay all fees in\r\n accordance with each Order. Unless otherwise specified in your Order, \r\nyou will pay all amounts in U.S. dollars at the time you place your \r\nOrder. Other than as expressly set forth in Section 10.1 (Return Policy)\r\n and Section 20 (IP Indemnification by Atlassian), all amounts are \r\nnon-refundable, non-cancelable and non-creditable. In making payments, \r\nyou acknowledge that you are not relying on future availability of any \r\nProducts beyond the current License Term or Subscription Term or any \r\nProduct upgrades or feature enhancements. If you add Authorized Users \r\nduring your License Term or Subscription Term, we will charge you for \r\nthe increased number of Authorized Users pursuant to the then-currently \r\napplicable rates in your next billing cycle. You agree that we may bill \r\nyour credit card for renewals, additional users, and unpaid fees, as \r\napplicable. If you purchase any Products through a Reseller, you owe \r\npayment to the Reseller as agreed between you and the Reseller, but you \r\nacknowledge that we may terminate your rights to use Products if we do \r\nnot receive our corresponding payment from the Reseller.</p> <p><strong>10.4 Taxes.</strong>\r\n Your payments under this Agreement exclude any taxes or duties payable \r\nin respect of the Products in the jurisdiction where the payment is \r\neither made or received. To the extent that any such taxes or duties are\r\n payable by Atlassian, you must pay to Atlassian the amount of such \r\ntaxes or duties in addition to any fees owed under this Agreement. \r\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, you may have obtained an exemption from \r\nrelevant taxes or duties as of the time such taxes or duties are levied \r\nor assessed. In that case, you will have the right to provide to \r\nAtlassian any such exemption information, and Atlassian will use \r\nreasonable efforts to provide such invoicing documents as may enable you\r\n to obtain a refund or credit for the amount so paid from any relevant \r\nrevenue authority if such a refund or credit is available.</p> <p><strong>11 No-Charge Products.</strong>\r\n We may offer certain Products to you at no charge, including free \r\naccounts, trial use, and access to Beta Versions as defined below (“<strong>No-Charge Products</strong>”).\r\n Your use of No-Charge Products is subject to any additional terms that \r\nwe specify and is only permitted for the period designated by us. You \r\nmay not use No-Charge Products for competitive analysis or similar \r\npurposes. We may terminate your right to use No-Charge Products at any \r\ntime and for any reason in our sole discretion, without liability to \r\nyou. You understand that any pre-release and beta products we make \r\navailable (“<strong>Beta Versions</strong>”) are still under \r\ndevelopment, may be inoperable or incomplete and are likely to contain \r\nmore errors and bugs than generally available Products. We make no \r\npromises that any Beta Versions will ever be made generally available. \r\nIn some circumstances, we may charge a fee in order to allow you to \r\naccess Beta Versions, but the Beta Versions will still remain subject to\r\n this Section 11 (No-Charge Products). All information regarding the \r\ncharacteristics, features or performance of Beta Versions constitutes \r\nAtlassian’s Confidential Information. To the maximum extent permitted by\r\n applicable law, we disclaim all obligations or liabilities with respect\r\n to No-Charge Products, including any Support and Maintenance, warranty,\r\n and indemnity obligations.</p> <p><strong>12 Restrictions. </strong> \r\nExcept as otherwise expressly permitted in this Agreement, you will not:\r\n (a) rent, lease, reproduce, modify, adapt, create derivative works of, \r\ndistribute, sell, sublicense, transfer, or provide access to the \r\nProducts to a third party, (b) use the Products for the benefit of any \r\nthird party, (c) incorporate any Products into a product or service you \r\nprovide to a third party, (d) interfere with any license key mechanism \r\nin the Products or otherwise circumvent mechanisms in the Products \r\nintended to limit your use, (e) reverse engineer, disassemble, \r\ndecompile, translate, or otherwise seek to obtain or derive the source \r\ncode, underlying ideas, algorithms, file formats or non-public APIs to \r\nany Products, except as permitted by law, (f) remove or obscure any \r\nproprietary or other notices contained in any Product, or (g) publicly \r\ndisseminate information regarding the performance of the Products.</p> <p><strong>13 Your Development of Add-Ons.</strong></p> <p><strong>13.1 License to Developer Guides.</strong> From time to time, Atlassian may publish SDK’s or API’s and associated guidelines (“<strong>Developer Guides</strong>”)\r\n to allow you to develop plugins, extensions, add-ons or other software \r\nproducts or services that interoperate or are integrated with the \r\nProducts (“<strong>Add-Ons</strong>”). You may distribute your Add-Ons \r\nto third parties, but only for those Products permitted by Atlassian, \r\nand only in accordance with the Developer Guides.</p> <p><strong>13.2 Conditions to Development of Add-Ons.</strong>\r\n Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Atlassian \r\nhas no support, warranty, indemnification or other obligation or \r\nliability with respect to your Add-Ons or their combination, interaction\r\n or use with the Products. You shall indemnify, defend and hold us \r\nharmless from and against any and all claims, costs, damages, losses, \r\nliabilities and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and \r\ncosts) arising out of or in connection with any claim brought against us\r\n by a third party relating to your Add-Ons (including but not limited to\r\n any representations or warranties you make about your Add-Ons) or your \r\nbreach of this Section.</p> <p><strong>14 License Certifications and Audits.</strong>\r\n At our request, you agree to provide a signed certification that you \r\nare using all Products pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, \r\nincluding the Scope of Use. You agree to allow us, or our authorized \r\nagent, to audit your use of the Products. We will provide you with at \r\nleast 10 days advance notice prior to the audit, and the audit will be \r\nconducted during normal business hours. We will bear all out-of-pocket \r\ncosts that we incur for the audit, unless the audit reveals that you \r\nhave exceeded the Scope of Use. You will provide reasonable assistance, \r\ncooperation, and access to relevant information in the course of any \r\naudit at your own cost. If you exceed your Scope of Use, we may invoice \r\nyou for any past or ongoing excessive use, and you will pay the invoice \r\npromptly after receipt. This remedy is without prejudice to any other \r\nremedies available to Atlassian at law or equity or under this \r\nAgreement. To the extent we are obligated to do so, we may share audit \r\nresults with certain of our third party licensors or assign the audit \r\nrights specified in this Section to such licensors.</p> <p><strong>15 Ownership and Feedback.</strong>\r\n Products are made available on a limited license or access basis, and \r\nno ownership right is conveyed to you, irrespective of the use of terms \r\nsuch as “purchase” or “sale”. Atlassian and its licensors have and \r\nretain all right, title and interest, including all intellectual \r\nproperty rights, in and to the Products (including all No-Charge \r\nProducts), their “look and feel”, any and all related or underlying \r\ntechnology, and any modifications or derivative works of the foregoing \r\ncreated by or for Atlassian, including without limitation as they may \r\nincorporate Feedback (“<strong>Atlassian Technology</strong>”). From \r\ntime to time, you may choose to submit comments, information, questions,\r\n data, ideas, description of processes, or other information to \r\nAtlassian, including sharing Your Modifications or in the course of \r\nreceiving Support and Maintenance (“<strong>Feedback</strong>”). \r\nAtlassian may in connection with any of its products or services freely \r\nuse, copy, disclose, license, distribute and exploit any Feedback in any\r\n manner without any obligation, royalty or restriction based on \r\nintellectual property rights or otherwise. No Feedback will be \r\nconsidered your Confidential Information, and nothing in this Agreement \r\nlimits Atlassian's right to independently use, develop, evaluate, or \r\nmarket products, whether incorporating Feedback or otherwise.</p> <p><strong>16 Confidentiality.</strong>\r\n Except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement, each party agrees that\r\n all code, inventions, know-how, business, technical and financial \r\ninformation disclosed to such party (“<strong>Receiving Party</strong>”) by the disclosing party (\"<strong>Disclosing Party</strong>\") constitute the confidential property of the Disclosing Party (\"<strong>Confidential Information</strong>\"),\r\n provided that it is identified as confidential at the time of \r\ndisclosure. Any Atlassian Technology and any performance information \r\nrelating to the Products shall be deemed Confidential Information of \r\nAtlassian without any marking or further designation. Except as \r\nexpressly authorized herein, the Receiving Party will hold in confidence\r\n and not use or disclose any Confidential Information. The Receiving \r\nParty's nondisclosure obligation shall not apply to information which \r\nthe Receiving Party can document: (i) was rightfully in its possession \r\nor known to it prior to receipt of the Confidential Information; (ii) is\r\n or has become public knowledge through no fault of the Receiving Party;\r\n (iii) is rightfully obtained by the Receiving Party from a third party \r\nwithout breach of any confidentiality obligation; or (iv) is \r\nindependently developed by employees of the Receiving Party who had no \r\naccess to such information. The Receiving Party may also disclose \r\nConfidential Information if so required pursuant to a regulation, law or\r\n court order (but only to the minimum extent required to comply with \r\nsuch regulation or order and with advance notice to the Disclosing \r\nParty). The Receiving Party acknowledges that disclosure of Confidential\r\n Information would cause substantial harm for which damages alone would \r\nnot be a sufficient remedy, and therefore that upon any such disclosure \r\nby the Receiving Party the Disclosing Party shall be entitled to \r\nappropriate equitable relief in addition to whatever other remedies it \r\nmight have at law. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section shall not \r\noperate as a separate warranty with respect to the operation of any \r\nProduct.</p> <p><strong>17 Term and Termination.</strong> This Agreement\r\n is in effect for as long as you have a valid License Term or \r\nSubscription Term (the “Term”), unless sooner terminated as permitted in\r\n this Agreement. Either party may terminate this Agreement before the \r\nexpiration of the Term if the other party materially breaches any of the\r\n terms of this Agreement and does not cure the breach within thirty (30)\r\n days after written notice of the breach. Either party may also \r\nterminate the Agreement before the expiration of the Term if the other \r\nparty ceases to operate, declares bankruptcy, or becomes insolvent or \r\notherwise unable to meet its financial obligations. You may terminate \r\nthis Agreement at any time with notice to Atlassian, but you will not be\r\n entitled to any credits or refunds as a result of convenience \r\ntermination for prepaid but unused Software, Hosted Services \r\nsubscriptions, or Support and Maintenance. Except where an exclusive \r\nremedy may be specified in this Agreement, the exercise by either party \r\nof any remedy, including termination, will be without prejudice to any \r\nother remedies it may have under this Agreement, by law, or otherwise. \r\nOnce the Agreement terminates, you (and your Authorized Users) will no \r\nlonger have any right to use or access any Products, or any information \r\nor materials that we make available to you under this Agreement, \r\nincluding Atlassian Confidential Information.

The parties agree that the limitations specified in \r\nthis Section 19 (Limitation of Liability) will survive and apply even if\r\n any limited remedy specified in this Agreement is found to have failed \r\nof its essential purpose.</p> <p><strong>20 IP Indemnification by Atlassian. </strong>\r\n We will defend you against any claim brought against you by a third \r\nparty alleging that a Product, when used as authorized under this \r\nAgreement, infringes a United States or European Union patent or \r\nregistered copyright (a “<strong>Claim</strong>”), and we will indemnify\r\n you and hold you harmless against any damages and costs finally awarded\r\n by a court of competent jurisdiction or agreed to settlement by \r\nAtlassian (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising out of a Claim,\r\n provided that we have received from you: (a) prompt written notice of \r\nthe claim (but in any event notice in sufficient time for us to respond \r\nwithout prejudice); (b) reasonable assistance in the defense and \r\ninvestigation of the claim, including providing us a copy of the claim \r\nand all relevant evidence in your possession, custody or control; and \r\n(c) the exclusive right to control and direct the investigation, \r\ndefense, and settlement (if applicable) of the claim. If your use of a \r\nProduct is (or in our opinion is likely to be) enjoined, if required by \r\nsettlement, or if we determine such actions are reasonably necessary to \r\navoid material liability, we may, at our option and in our discretion: \r\n(i) procure a license for your continued use of the Product in \r\naccordance with this Agreement; (ii) substitute a substantially \r\nfunctionally similar Product; or (iii) terminate your right to continue \r\nusing the Product and refund, in the case of Software, the license fee \r\npaid by you as reduced to reflect a three year straight-line \r\ndepreciation from the license purchase date, and in the case of a Hosted\r\n Service, any prepaid amounts for the terminated portion of the \r\nSubscription Term. Atlassian’s indemnification obligations above do not \r\napply: (1) if the total aggregate fees received by Atlassian with \r\nrespect to your license to Software or subscription to Hosted Services \r\nin the 12 month period immediately preceding the claim is less than \r\nUS$50,000; (2) if the Product is modified by any party other than \r\nAtlassian, but solely to the extent the alleged infringement is caused \r\nby such modification; (3) if the Product is used in combination with any\r\n non-Atlassian product, software or equipment, but solely to the extent \r\nthe alleged infringement is caused by such combination; (4) to \r\nunauthorized use of Products; (5) to any Claim arising as a result of \r\n(y) Your Data (or circumstances covered by your indemnification \r\nobligations in Section 7.7.3 (Indemnity for Your Data)) or (z) any \r\nthird-party deliverables or components contained with the Products; (6) \r\nto any unsupported release of the Software; or (7) if you settle or make\r\n any admissions with respect to a claim without Atlassian’s prior \r\nwritten consent. THIS SECTION 20 (IP INDEMNIFICATION BY ATLASSIAN) \r\nSTATES OUR SOLE LIABILITY AND YOUR EXCLUSIVE REMEDY FOR ANY INFRINGEMENT\r\n OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS IN CONNECTION WITH ANY PRODUCT OR OTHER\r\n ITEMS PROVIDED BY ATLASSIAN UNDER THIS AGREEMENT.</p> <p><strong>21 Third Party Vendor Products.</strong>\r\n Atlassian or third parties may from time to time make available to you \r\n(e.g., through the Atlassian Marketplace) third-party products or \r\nservices, including but not limited to add-ons and plugins as well as \r\nimplementation, customization, training, and other consulting services. \r\nIf you procure any of these third party products or services, you do so \r\nunder a separate agreement (and exchange of data) solely between you and\r\n the third party vendor. Atlassian does not warrant or support \r\nnon-Atlassian products or services, whether or not they are designated \r\nby Atlassian as “verified” or otherwise, and disclaims all liability for\r\n such products or services. If you install or enable any third party \r\nproducts or services for use with Atlassian products, you acknowledge \r\nthat Atlassian may allow the vendors of those products and services to \r\naccess Your Data as required for the interoperation and support of such \r\nadd-ons with the Atlassian products.

The parties shall seek to mutually appoint an \r\narbitrator. If the parties cannot agree on a single arbitrator, then \r\nthere shall be three (3) arbitrators: one selected by each party, and a \r\nthird selected by the first two. Arbitration will take place in one of \r\nthe following cities as mutually agreed between the parties: Sydney \r\n(Australia), Amsterdam (Netherlands) or San Francisco, CA (USA). If the \r\nparties are unable to agree to one of these cities, then the arbitration\r\n shall proceed in San Francisco, CA. All negotiations and arbitration \r\nproceedings pursuant to this Section will be confidential and treated as\r\n compromise and settlement negotiations for purposes of all similar \r\nrules and codes of evidence of applicable legislation and jurisdictions.\r\n The language of the arbitration shall be English.</p> <p><strong>24.2 Governing Law; Jurisdiction.</strong>\r\n This Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the\r\n applicable laws of the State of California, USA, without giving effect \r\nto the principles of that State relating to conflicts of laws. Each \r\nparty irrevocably agrees that any legal action, suit or proceeding that \r\nis not otherwise subject to the arbitration provisions of Section 24.1 \r\n(Dispute Resolution; Arbitration) must be brought solely and exclusively\r\n in, and will be subject to the service of process and other applicable \r\nprocedural rules of, the State or Federal court in San Francisco, \r\nCalifornia, USA, and each party irrevocably submits to the sole and \r\nexclusive personal jurisdiction of the courts in San Francisco, \r\nCalifornia, USA, generally and unconditionally, with respect to any \r\naction, suit or proceeding brought by it or against it by the other \r\nparty. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Atlassian may bring a claim for \r\nequitable relief in any court with proper jurisdiction.</p> <p><strong>24.3 Injunctive Relief; Enforcement.</strong>\r\n Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 24.1 (Dispute Resolution; \r\nArbitration), nothing in this Agreement shall prevent either party from \r\nseeking injunctive relief with respect to a violation of intellectual \r\nproperty rights, confidentiality obligations or enforcement or \r\nrecognition of any award or order in any appropriate jurisdiction.</p> <p><strong>24.4 Exclusion of UN Convention and UCITA. </strong>The\r\n terms of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the Sale of \r\nGoods do not apply to this Agreement. The Uniform Computer Information \r\nTransactions Act (UCITA) shall not apply to this Agreement regardless of\r\n when or where adopted.</p> <p><strong>25 Export Restrictions. </strong>\r\n The Products are subject to export restrictions by the United States \r\ngovernment and import restrictions by certain foreign governments, and \r\nyou agree to comply with all applicable export and import laws and \r\nregulations in your use of the Products. You shall not (and shall not \r\nallow any third-party to) remove or export from the United States or \r\nallow the export or re-export of any part of the Products or any direct \r\nproduct thereof: (a) into (or to a national or resident of) any \r\nembargoed or terrorist-supporting country; (b) to anyone on the U.S. \r\nCommerce Department’s Table of Denial Orders or U.S. Treasury \r\nDepartment’s list of Specially Designated Nationals; (c) to any country \r\nto which such export or re-export is restricted or prohibited, or as to \r\nwhich the United States government or any agency thereof requires an \r\nexport license or other governmental approval at the time of export or \r\nre-export without first obtaining such license or approval; or (d) \r\notherwise in violation of any export or import restrictions, laws or \r\nregulations of any United States or foreign agency or authority. You \r\nrepresent and warrant that (i) you are not located in, under the control\r\n of, or a national or resident of any such prohibited country or on any \r\nsuch prohibited party list and (ii) that none of Your Data is controlled\r\n under the US International Traffic in Arms Regulations.

Neither party shall be liable to the other for any delay or \r\nfailure to perform any obligation under this Agreement (except for a \r\nfailure to pay fees) if the delay or failure is due to unforeseen events\r\n which are beyond the reasonable control of such party, such as a \r\nstrike, blockade, war, act of terrorism, riot, natural disaster, failure\r\n or diminishment of power or telecommunications or data networks or \r\nservices, or refusal of a license by a government agency.
