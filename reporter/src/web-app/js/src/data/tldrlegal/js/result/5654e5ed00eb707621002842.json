  "description": "<p>The Fair Source License is not an open source license, but it allows everyone to see the source code and makes the software free to use for a limited number of users in your organization. It thus offers source visibility and lowered barriers to small-scale initial deployment, while preserving a monopoly on charging for downstream copies and on significant organizational use.</p><p>Any individual user can view, download, execute, and modify the code free of charge. Up to a certain number of users from an organization can use the code for free, too. After an organization hits that user limit, it will start paying a licensing fee determined by the software publisher.</p>",
