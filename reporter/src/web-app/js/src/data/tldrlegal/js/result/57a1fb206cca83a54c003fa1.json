(referred to as \"the COS\", \"Open Science Framework\", \"OSF\", \"us\" \"our\" and \"we\") is a nonprofit organization that operates certain websites at the cos.io (or centerforopenscience.org) and the osf.io (or openscienceframework.org) URLs (\"Websites\" or \"Services\"). The COS conducts research on scientific practices and provides grants for relevant projects. The COS fosters an open and interactive community among open source developers, open science researchers, and the broader scientific community. We also support and improve the scientific workflow by connecting technologies that researchers use by means of our development and administration of the Open Science Framework.</p><p>Our mission is to increase the openness, integrity, and reproducibility of scientific research and scholarly communication by creating and operating an open access infrastructure (referred to as \"OSF\" or the \"Framework\") to support the entire research lifecycle from planning, execution, reporting, archiving and discovery. The use of our Websites and Services are free of charge. These Terms of Use apply to contributors of content to, and users of, our Websites and Services.</p><p>These Terms of Use describe the conditions under which the COS allows the public to use the Websites and Services.</p></li><li>TERMS OF USE\r\n<p>In order to use the Websites and Services made available on the sites, whether by accessing our Websites directly or by using a public application programming interface (\"Public API\") to access our Websites and Services, you must first agree to these Terms of Use. You may not use the Websites or Services if you do not accept these terms. You can accept these terms by clicking to accept or agree to these terms where we've provided you with clickable electronic assent option or by actually using the services offered at the Websites. If you are using the Websites or Services on behalf of a business or organization, your assent to these terms constitutes a binding legal agreement that that business or organization for which you're acting as a representative accepts these terms. Any such business or organization will hold harmless and indemnify the COS, and its agents and representatives, and its and their directors, officers and employees from and against any liability, damage, loss, cost or expense (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees) arising from or relating to its and your use of the Websites and Services, including data or software deposited by you or it, or in violation of these Terms of Use. You understand and agree that we will treat your use of the Websites and Services offered thereon as acceptance of these terms.</p><p>Our <a href=\"https://github.com/CenterForOpenScience/centerforopenscience.org/blob/master/PRIVACY_POLICY.md\">Privacy Policy</a>, which is incorporated by reference into these Terms of Use, explains how we treat your personal data and your privacy when you use our Websites and Services. By using our Websites and Services, you agree that the COS can use such data in accordance with our Privacy Policy.</p></li><li>MODIFICATIONS TO THESE TERMS OF USE\r\n<p>We may modify these Terms of Use from time to time by posting a revised version on our Websites and/or Services. Your continued use of the Websites or Services after the posting of such new Terms of Use means that you agree to the posted changes. If you do not agree to the changes, you should discontinue use of the Websites and Services. If there is a conflict between these Terms of Use and the updated and/or additional terms and conditions, the updated and/or additional terms and conditions will control.</p><p>If you have questions about our Websites and Services, please contact us by email us at <a href=\"mailto:contact@cos.io\">contact@cos.io</a>.</p></li><li>DEFINITIONS\r\n<p>In this document, we use \"you\" to refer to researchers and other users of the Websites and OSF. We also use the following defined terms:</p><p>a. Project. A \"Project\" is an individual or collaborative enterprise that also may have embedded within it subproject(s) or \"Project components\" or \"component(s)\" of the Project.</p><p>b. Content. As used in these Terms of Use, \"content\" means, but is not limited to, any research, data, text, images, software and software code, data sets, information or other materials.</p><p>c. Users. All Users must accept the COS Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.</p><ol>\r\n<li>Administrator. An administrator on a Project or a component is an individual who has full rights to control all aspects of a Project. An Administrator may create a Project or components of a Project, create and change contributor permissions, identify the legal terms that govern the ownership of the intellectual property in Content deposited into a Project or a Project component or identify the license restrictions governing the use of the intellectual property incorporated into the Project or a Project component, control and modify access and privacy settings for the Project and its components, modify license terms for the use of Content, invite other users to contribute to a Project or a component of a project, authorize add-ons, namely, software designed to increase the capability of OSF, remove Projects or Project Components from the Websites and Services, register (i.e. freeze and uniquely identify) Projects or Project Components. Administrators must have the authority to bind the individual Administrator's business, organization or institution to the COS's Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.</li><li>Proxy. A Proxy is a person to whom the Administrator has granted the authority to manage a Project or Project component on his or her behalf, which may include setting and modifying user access, privacy settings, license terms, and editing and depositing Content.</li><li>Contributing User. A Contributing User may access, deposit, and edit Content to a Project or a Project component.</li><li>Active User. An Active User may have select interactive use of the Websites and Services, subject to restrictions imposed by the Administrator.</li><li>Passive User. A passive user, including journal editors/reviewers, other scientists, and members of the general public, may use the Websites and Services solely as an information resource without any ability to change or modify any Project content.</li></ol><p>d. Public API: An application program interface available to the public to facilitate computer communication with the OSF. Parts or all of the Websites and Services are accessible via various Public APIs, including but not limited to, GitHub, Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, Google Scholar and Google Groups, and LinkedIn.</p><p>e. Privacy Settings. Privacy Settings define whether Project Content may be publicly displayed, displayed with restricted access to a limited group, or private.</p><p>f. Trusted Party: A Trusted Party is an individual or organization to which the Administrator has given the right to view, edit, and/or deposit specific data within a Project or Project component.</p></li><li>YOUR RIGHT TO USE OSF\r\n<p>The Websites and OSF contain technology that is owned by the COS or third parties and materials, including the OSF, that are owned by the COS or its third party licensors. The COS makes the OSF software available on an open source basis. The COS grants you a limited license to make use of the OSF software on which the OSF is based and the Public API to access and search the Websites and Services. In addition, the COS grants you a license to use any Content marked \"public,\" subject to patent, copyright and trademark law and these Terms of Use, including the limits described in the section governing Limitations on Use below. By \"use\" we mean sublicense, reproduce, store, transmit, distribute, and publicly display the Content for non-commercial and commercial uses. If a Project contains links to full text articles or other materials, this license does not extend to the linked materials. You may download and modify Content, but only in manner consistent with copyright law and that does not make the data false or misleading. Additional restrictions may apply with respect to specific Content, in which case these restrictions will be identified with the Content.</p></li><li>PRIVACY SETTINGS RESTRICTING ACCESS TO CONTENT\r\n<p>The COS supports open access to information in the research community. The COS shares with the public free of charge any data marked as Public through its Websites and Services for viewing and use, including commercial uses, unless otherwise noted. If you deposit Content into OSF, you still own the Content, but you grant the COS and its authorized users a license to use it. Specifically, by depositing any Content (including data and links, but not the linked content) in a COS account, you grant the COS and its users a perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-free license to sublicense, reproduce, store, modify, transmit, distribute, publicly perform and publicly display such Content, subject to the Privacy Settings the Administrator or Proxy selects. This limited license continues even after you stop using the COS database. If you or the Administrator previously made Content publicly available through the Websites and Services, there is no way to stop the public from continuing to use that Content, given the public nature of the Internet.</p><p>If you contribute software code designed to modify and enhance the OSF, the underlying technology platform upon which all Projects are stored, you continue to own the code, but you grant the COS and its authorized users a perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-free license to sublicense, reproduce, store, modify, transmit, distribute, publicly perform and publicly display the code, subject to the terms of the open source license the COS designates.</p><p>Our Privacy Settings for Projects are summarized below.</p><p>a. Public. Content marked as \"Public\" will be available to the public for viewing and commercial and non-commercial use under the terms of the license identified by the Administrator.</p><p>b. Private. Content marked as \"Private\" may be viewed through the OSF or Public API only by the Administrator(s), a Contributing User of that Project or Component, anyone with a view-only link created by an Administrator, or any designated Proxy. Private data are not shared with the public, Trusted Parties or other members of the COS. Only the COS employees and our authorized agents' or contractors' staff, with a \"need to know\" access to manage the Websites and Services and process data for the COS are able to view Private Access Data.</p></li><li>YOUR REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES\r\n<p>You represent and warrant to the COS that:</p><p>a. If you host a Project on the OSF, you are authorized to do so with the COS and that you have the authority to bind the business or organization that you represent to these Terms of Use and our Privacy Policy.</p><p>b. If you are an Administrator, you are not misrepresenting your identity or organizational affiliations in any manner.</p><p>c. All data you deposit is true and correct at the time of deposit. If you later discover that any data was not true and correct at the time of deposit, you must correct the data.</p><p>d. The license you grant to the COS and the public to any content, data, texts, blogs, software code, data sets, links or other materials, or other content you deposit, does not infringe on the copyright or other rights of a third party.</p><p>e. If you are a registered user, you will update and maintain the accuracy of your contact information.</p></li><li>AUDIT TRAILS\r\n<p>To ensure the transparency of the COS and as a feature of the OSF, we may, but are not required to, keep an audit trail log when and by whom Project data or information has been deposited or changed and any changes to a Project's privacy settings. While the COS requires all data deposited be accurate, the COS takes no responsibility for the accuracy of the data on the Websites or the Services. You agree to hold the COS and its representatives and agents, and its and their directors, officers and employees, harmless regarding any disputes regarding data deposits and privacy settings and any claims, regardless of theory of law, arising from such disputes.</p></li><li>PERMITTED AND PROHIBITED USES\r\n<p>The COS operates open services developed by and for the research community. We encourage you to consider community norms and expectations in your use of the Websites and Services.</p><p>You may not use the Websites or Services to violate any applicable local, state, national, or international law, including without limitation any applicable laws relating to antitrust or other illegal trade or business practices, federal and state securities laws, regulations promulgated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, any rules of any national or other securities exchange, and any U.S. laws, rules, and regulations governing the export and re-export of commodities or technical data. You may not upload or transmit any data, content, or material that infringes or misappropriates any person's copyright, patent, trademark, or trade secret, or disclose via the Websites or Services any information the disclosure of which would constitute a violation of any confidentiality obligation on your part. You may not upload any viruses, worms, Trojan horses, or other forms of harmful computer code, nor subject the COS's networks or servers to unreasonable traffic loads, or otherwise engage in conduct deemed disruptive to the ordinary operation of the COS's Websites and Services. You're strictly prohibited from communicating on or through this site any unlawful, harmful, offensive, threatening, abusive, libelous, harassing, defamatory, vulgar, obscene, profane, hateful, fraudulent, sexually explicit, racially, ethnically, or otherwise objectionable material of any sort, including, but not limited to, any material that encourages conduct that would constitute a criminal offense, give rise to civil liability, or otherwise violate any applicable local, state, national, or international law. You are further prohibited from harvesting addresses, email addresses or other personal data for commercial purposes and from sending unsolicited or unauthorized advertising, promotional materials, or other unsolicited communications to other users of the Websites or Services. You may not use the Websites or Services in a way that harms the COS or the COS's members, affiliates or vendors, or other users. You may not deposit, edit, modify or otherwise use any data in a manner that makes it false, incomplete or misleading. You may not manipulate identifiers to disguise the origin of any data. You may not use COS or the COS marks in any way to suggest an affiliation with or endorsement by the COS of any individual, organization, product, service, or research.</p><p>You acknowledge that your unauthorized use or misuse of the Websites and Services could cause the COS irreparable harm. Any unauthorized use of the Websites or Services or other breach of these Terms of Use shall automatically terminate the license granted to you by the COS. In addition, the COS reserves the right, but is not obligated to, investigate any potential violations of its Terms of Use and/or any behavior that is potentially unlawful, and such investigations may involve cooperation with law enforcement authorities.</p></li><li>LIMITATION OF ACCESS AND REMOVAL OF CONTENT\r\n<p>The COS makes commercially reasonable efforts to maintain and provide access to its Websites and Services and will endeavor to provide you with advance warning of restrictions to access due to routine website maintenance. The COS, at its sole discretion, however, reserves the right at any time and from time to time to modify, suspend, discontinue or terminate the Websites or Services or portions thereof with or without notice. You agree that we will not be liable to you or to any third party for any modification, suspension, discontinuation or termination of the Websites or Services. While the COS will endeavor to continue to host all Projects, as a non-profit entity, it cannot guarantee that it will have the resources to do so over time, and it reserves the right to designate a substitute host of its choosing for Project content if the COS does not have the financial means to do so itself in the future.</p><p>The COS is not responsible for screening or reviewing content submitted to the Websites or Services. The COS may temporarily or permanently remove any content on the Websites or Services at any time where the COS, in its sole discretion believes the content is in violation of these Terms of Service or where the COS is acting in compliance with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. You are advised not to use the Websites or Services as the exclusive storage repository for your data and content. The COS recommends that you separately store all data and content submitted to the Websites and Services on other secure servers or with reputable third party hosting services.</p></li><li>SECURITY\r\n<p>The COS uses commercially reasonable, industry-standard measures to protect the security of the COS's Websites and its Services. Despite these measures, we cannot guarantee that unauthorized persons will not be able to defeat our security measures. Your access to some of our Websites and Services and content may be password protected. To maintain the security of your information (or another user's personal information that you are authorized to manage as an Administrator), you must keep your username(s) and password(s) strictly confidential and not disclose them to anyone. You will be solely responsible for any action, activities, and access to our Websites and Services that are taken using your username and password and that occurred before you notified us of their loss. If you become aware of any security breach of your password or of the security of the Websites or Services, you must contact us as soon as possible.</p></li><li>LINKS AND ADD-ONS\r\n<p>The Websites and Services may contain links or allow you to make use of Add-ons that connect to sites owned or operated by independent third parties. These links are provided for your convenience and reference only. The COS's Terms of Use and Privacy Policy do not apply to those sites. We do not control such sites and, therefore, we are not responsible for any content posted on these sites or their privacy policies. The fact that the COS offers such links should not be construed in any way as an endorsement, authorization, or sponsorship of that site, its content or the companies or products or services referenced therein, and the COS reserves the right to note its lack of affiliation, sponsorship, or endorsement of these sites. If you decide to access any of the third party sites linked to the COS's Websites or Services, you do this entirely at your own risk. Because some sites employ automated search results or otherwise link you to sites containing information that may be deemed inappropriate or offensive, the COS cannot be held responsible for the accuracy, copyright compliance, legality, or decency of material contained in third party sites or any results that may be obtained from using them. You hereby irrevocably waive any claim against us with respect to such sites.</p></li><li>INDEMNIFICATION\r\n<p>You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless the COS, its employees, directors, officers, affiliated companies, agents, vendors or suppliers from and against any and all claims, damages, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, arising from or related to your use or misuse of the Websites and Services, including, without limitation, your use of any Public API or third party products accessing the Websites or Services via a Public API, your violation of these Terms of Use, or your infringement or that of any other user of your account, of any intellectual property right or other right of any person or entity.</p></li><li>TERMINATION\r\n<p>These Terms of Use are effective until terminated by either party. If you no longer agree to be bound by these Terms, you must cease use of the Websites and Services. If you're dissatisfied with the Websites, their content, our Services or any of these terms, conditions, and policies, your sole legal remedy is to discontinue using the Websites and Services. The COS reserves the right to terminate or suspend your access to and use of the Websites and Services, or parts of the Websites and Services, without notice, if we believe, in our sole discretion, that such use is (i) in violation of any applicable law; (ii) is harmful to our interests or the interests, including intellectual property or other rights, of another person or entity; or (iii) where the COS has reason to believe that you are in violation of these Terms of Use. Termination for any reason shall not terminate any of your warranties or any of your indemnification and other obligations under these Terms of Use, or any licenses that you have license, use or other rights that you may have granted in connection with any of your contributions.</p></li><li>WARRANTY DISCLAIMER\r\n<p>THE WEBSITES AND SERVICES ARE PROVIDED ON AN \"AS IS\" AND \"AS AVAILABLE\" BASIS. TO THE FULL EXTENT PERMISSIBLE BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE COS DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY.

THIS DISCLAIMER CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS AGREEMENT. BECAUSE SOME JURISDICTIONS PROHIBIT THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p><p>YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT ANY DATA, CONTENT, OR SOFTWARE DOWNLOADED OR OTHERWISE OBTAINED THROUGH THE USE OF THE WEBSITES, SERVICES, OR APPLICATION PROGRAMMING INTERFACES OR ANY THIRD PARTY PRODUCT ACCESSING THE WEBSITES AND SERVICES IS AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK AND THAT YOU WILL BE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE TO YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM(S) OR LOSS OF DATA OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION THAT RESULTS FROM THE DOWNLOAD OF DATA, CONTENT, OR SERVICES. THE COS SHALL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY LOSS OR DAMAGE CAUSED, OR ALLEGED TO HAVE BEEN CAUSED, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, BY THE INFORMATION OR IDEAS OR RESEARCH CONTAINED, SUGGESTED OR REFERENCED IN OR APPEARING ON THE WEBSITES. YOUR USE AND PARTICIPATION IN THE WEBSITES AND SERVICES IS SOLELY AT YOUR OWN RISK. NO ADVICE OR INFORMATION, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, OBTAINED BY YOU FROM THE COS OR THROUGH THE COS, ITS EMPLOYEES, OR THIRD PARTIES SHALL CREATE ANY WARRANTY NOT EXPRESSLY MADE HEREIN. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE, BY YOUR USE OF THE WEBSITES AND SERVICES, THAT YOUR USE OF THE WEBSITES AND SERVICES IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK.</p></li><li>LIABILITY LIMITATION\r\n<p>UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY, WHETHER IN TORT, CONTRACT, NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, SHALL THE COS OR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATED COMPANIES, EMPLOYEES, DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, AGENTS, VENDORS OR SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE TO YOU OR TO ANY OTHER PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL LOSSES OR DAMAGES OF ANY NATURE ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE WEBSITES OR SERVICES OR FOR ANY BREACH OF SECURITY ASSOCIATED WITH THE TRANSMISSION OF SENSITIVE INFORMATION THROUGH THE WEBSITES OR SERVICES OR FOR ANY INFORMATION OBTAINED THROUGH THE WEBSITES OR SERVICES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, LOSS OR CORRUPTION OF DATA, WORK STOPPAGE, ACCURACY OF RESULTS, OR COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, EVEN IF AN AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OF THE COS HAS BEEN ADVISED OF OR SHOULD HAVE KNOWN OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</p><p>THE COS'S TOTAL CUMULATIVE LIABILITY FOR ANY AND ALL CLAIMS IN CONNECTION WITH THE WEBSITE WILL NOT EXCEED ONE THOUSAND U.S. DOLLARS ($1,000.00). YOU AGREE AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS ON LIABILITY ARE AN ESSENTIAL BASIS OF THE BARGAIN AND THAT THE COS WOULD NOT PROVIDE THE WEBSITES OR SERVICES ABSENT SUCH LIMITATION.</p></li><li>USE OF SOFTWARE\r\n<p>If you download code or software tools (the \"Software\") from the Websites or Services, the use of the Software is subject to the license terms in the Software License Agreement that accompanies or is provided with the Software. If a Software License Agreement does not accompany or is not provided with the Software and the Software is sample or beta code or is provided for evaluation purposes, then you must contact the Project Administrator for the applicable Software License Agreement. You may not download or install the Software until you have read and accepted the terms of the applicable Software License Agreement.</p></li><li>TRADEMARKS\r\n<p>Center for Open Science, COS, Open Science Framework, OSF and their associated logos (collectively, \"COS Marks\") are trademarks or service marks of the COS and/or its licensors and may not be copied, imitated or used, in whole or in part, without the prior written permission of the COS or the applicable trademark holder.

Reference to any product vendors, service providers, laboratories, auditors, products, services, processes or other information, whether by trade name, trademark, manufacturer, supplier or otherwise, does not constitute or imply endorsement, sponsorship or recommendation thereof.</p></li><li>ASSIGNMENT\r\n<p>Users may not assign or otherwise transfer the rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of the COS, which assignment will not be unreasonably refused. Any purported transfer without the COS's written authorization shall be void. The COS reserves the right to transfer all of its rights and obligations under these Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, including ownership and/or operation of the COS to another non-profit entity continuing the COS's purpose, in the event of a merger, joint venture, dissolution, or other organizational change. In no event shall the COS's merger with or assignment of rights and obligations to a successor entity that carries on the COS's purpose constitute a material breach or cessation of operations under these Terms.</p></li><li>PROCEDURE FOR MAKING CLAIMS OF COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT\r\n<p>In accordance with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (17 USC § 512), any notifications of claimed copyright infringement must be sent to our Designated Agent:</p><p>Andrew Sallans<br>Center for Open Science<br>210 Ridge McIntire Rd.<br>Suite 500, Charlottesville, VA, 22903</p><p>or sent via e-mail to</p><p><a href=\"mailto:copyright@cos.io\">copyright@cos.io</a></p></li><li>GENERAL</li></ol><p>The COS is based in the United States.

Not all information sharing is covered by the \"Shine the Light\" requirements and only information on covered sharing will be included in our response.</p></li><li>SECURITY\r\n<p>We have implemented industry-standard security safeguards designed to protect the personal information that you may provide. We also periodically monitor our system for possible vulnerabilities and attacks, consistent with industry standards. You should be aware, however, that since the Internet is not a 100% secure environment, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information that you submit to the site. There's also no guarantee that information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards. It's your responsibility to protect the security and integrity of your account details, including your username and password. To maintain the security of your information (or another user's personal information that you are authorized to manage as an Administrator), you must keep your username(s) and password(s) strictly confidential and not disclose them to anyone. You will be solely responsible for any action, activities, and access to our Websites and Services that are taken using your username and password and that occurred before you notified us of their loss. If you become aware of any security breach of your password or of the security of the Websites or Services, you must contact us as soon as possible at <a href=\"mailto:security@osf.io\">security@osf.io</a>.</p></li><li>TYPES OF INFORMATION WE COLLECT\r\n<p>(a) Registration.</p><p>Unless you are a member of the general public with limited viewing rights, in order to fully use the COS Websites and Services, you will need to create an account by providing us with at least your name, email address, and a password. You can choose to provide other information about yourself in your account profile during the registration process (for example, your organizational or company affiliation, your level of education, location, your job title, professional experience, professional affiliations and memberships, etc.). This information that you voluntarily provide may be seen by other users who view your profile.</p><p>We use this additional information to provide you with more customized services, and this information may be viewable by others. You understand that, by creating or claiming an account, COS and others within your Project's level of access will be able to identify you by your profile, and you agree to allow COS to use this information in accordance with this Privacy Policy and our <a href=\"https://github.com/CenterForOpenScience/centerforopenscience.org/blob/master/TERMS_OF_USE.md\">Terms of Use</a>. You must follow this link to our Terms of Use in order to understand the terms of your relationship with COS. On some pages of our Websites, you may be able to request information, subscribe to mailing lists, participate in online discussions, collaborate on documents, provide feedback, submit information into registries, register for events, apply for membership, or join committees or working groups. The types of personal information you provide to us on these pages may include your name, address, phone number, e-mail address, user IDs, passwords, or other information that relates to you personally.</p><p>(b) Group Participation.</p><p>We may collect information when you use our Websites, such as when you join and participate in any group, participate in any polls or surveys, or otherwise interact with other users within the community.</p><p>(c) Non-Personal Information.</p><p>Non-personal information is data about usage and service operation that is not directly associated with a specific personal identity COS may collect, analyze, and share aggregated non-personal information to evaluate how visitors use our Websites and Services.</p><p>(d) Aggregate Information.</p><p>COS may collect aggregate information, which refers to information your computer automatically provides us and that cannot be tied back to you as a specific individual. This information can be shared with third parties without restriction. Examples include referral data (the sites you visited just before and just after our site), the pages viewed, the date of your visit, time spent at our Websites, and your Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you access the Internet. For example, when you request a page from one of our sites, our servers log your IP address to create aggregate reports on user demographics, traffic patterns, metascience, and for purposes of system administration.</p><p>(e) Log Files and IP Addresses.</p><p>We may collect information from the devices and networks that you use to visit the Websites in order to help improve the services we provide. Every time you request or download a file from the site, COS may store data about these events and your IP address in a log file. We may use this information to analyze trends, administer the site, track users' movements, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use or for other business purposes. When you access or leave our Websites by clicking on a hyperlink, we receive the URL from the site from which you last visited or the one to which you're directed. We may receive the Internet Protocol (\"IP\") address of your computer or proxy server used to access the site, your operating system, the type of browser you used, and the type of device and/or operating system you use, the Application Programming Interface (\"API\") you use, or your mobile device carrier or your ISP. We also may receive location data passed to us from third-party services or GPS-enabled devices that you have set up in order to customize your experience based on location information.</p><p>(f) Cookies.</p><p>We use cookies and similar technologies, including mobile device identifiers, to help us recognize you when you log into our Websites and Services. By accessing our Websites, you are consenting to the placement of cookies and other similar technologies in your browser in accordance with this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use.</p><p>Cookies are small packets of information that a site's computer stores on your computer. COS can then read the cookies whenever you visit our Websites. We may use cookies in a number of ways, such as to save the fact that you are logged into the system so you don't have to relogin each time you visit our Websites, to deliver content specific to your interests, and to track the pages you've visited. These cookies allow us to use the information we collect to customize your experience so that your visit to our Websites and your use of our Services are as relevant and as valuable to you as possible. You may modify and control how and when cookies are set through your browser settings. Most browsers offer instructions on how to reset the browser to control or reject cookies in the \"Help\" section of the toolbar. We do not link non-personal information from cookies to personally identifiable information without your permission.</p><p>(g) Web Beacons.</p><p>Our Websites also may use web beacons and other technologies, such as pixels and javascript tags, to collect non-personal information about your use of our site and the sites you visit, your use of special announcements or newsletters, and other activities. The information collected by web beacons allows us, for example, to statistically monitor how many people are using our Websites; how many people open our emails; and for what purposes these actions are being taken. We do not share personally identifiable information with any third-party advertisers, but we may show you sponsored content from our members and affiliates.</p><p>(h) New Technologies.</p><p>As new technologies emerge, COS may be able to improve our services or provide you with new ones, which means that COS may create new ways to collect information on our Websites. If we offer a new service or new features to our existing Websites, for example, these changes may result in our collecting new information in order to improve your user experience.</p></li><li>COS ADMINISTRATORS AND MODERATORS\r\n<p>If you contact COS, we collect information that helps us categorize your question or report, respond to it, and, if applicable, investigate any breach of our Terms of Use or this Privacy Policy. We also may use this information to track potential problems and trends in order to improve our services to you and to the community as a whole.</p></li><li>LINKS TO THIRD-PARTY SITES AND SERVICES\r\n<p>Our Websites and Services may provide links to third-party sites for the convenience of our users. If you access those links or third-party add-ons, you will leave our Websites or use the services of another Website. COS does not control these third-party sites and cannot represent that their policies and practices will be consistent with this Privacy Policy or our Terms of Use. For example, other sites may collect or use personal information about you in a manner different from that described in this document. You should be aware that materials available through third-party sites may be protected from unauthorized copying and dissemination by U.S. copyright law, trademark law, international conventions, and other intellectual property laws, and the usage of such materials may be subject to limitations that are more or less restrictive than those expressed herein. Therefore, you should use other sites with caution, and you do so at your own risk. We encourage you to review the privacy policy of any site before submitting personal information.</p><p>We may receive information when you use your account to log into a third-party site or application in order to recommend tailored information to you and to improve your user experience on our Websites. We may provide reports containing aggregated impression information to third parties to measure Internet traffic and usage patterns.</p></li><li>DEFINITIONS.\r\n<p>In our Privacy Policy and Terms of Use, we use \"you\" to refer to researchers and other users of the Websites and OSF. We also use the following defined terms:</p><p>(a) Project. A \"Project\" is an individual or collaborative enterprise that also may have oversight and control over smaller component(s) of the Project.</p><p>(b). Content. As used in these Terms of Use, \"content\" means any research, data, text, images, software and software code, data sets, information or other materials.</p><p>(c) Users. All Users must accept the COS Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.</p><p>(d) Administrator. An administrator is an individual who has full rights to control all aspects of a Project. An Administrator may create a Project or components of a Project, create and change passwords, create and change permissions, identify the legal terms that govern the ownership of the intellectual property in Content deposited into a Project or a Project component or identify the license restrictions governing the use of the intellectual property incorporated into the Project or a Project component, control and modify access and privacy settings for the Project and its components, create templates for the administration of a Project, set and modify license terms for the use of Content, invite other users to contribute to a Project or a component of a project, authorize Public API add-ons, remove Projects or Project Components from the COS Websites and Services. Administrators must have the authority to bind the individual Administrator's business, organization or institution to COS's Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.</p><p>(e) Proxy. A Proxy is a person to whom the Administrator has granted the authority to manage a Project or Project component on his or her behalf, which may including setting and modifying user access, privacy settings, license terms, and editing and depositing Content.</p><p>(f) Contributing User. A Contributing User may access, deposit, and edit Content to a Project or a Project component.</p><p>(g) Active User. An Active User may have select interactive use of the COS Websites and Services, subject to restrictions imposed by the Administrator.</p><p>(h) Passive User. A passive user, including journal editors/reviewers, other scientists, and members of the general public, may use the COS Websites and Services solely as an information resource without any ability to change or modify any Project content.</p><p>(i) Public API. An application program interface available to the public to facilitate computer communication with OSF. COS Websites and Services are accessible via various Public APIs, including but not limited to, GitHub, Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, Google Scholar and Google Groups, and LinkedIn.</p><p>(j) Privacy Settings. Privacy Settings define whether Project Content may be publicly displayed, displayed with restricted access to a limited group, or private.</p><p>(k) Trusted Party. A Trusted Party is an individual or organization to which the Administrator has given the right to view, edit, and/or deposit specific data within a Project or Project component.</p></li><li>PRIVACY SETTINGS\r\n<p>Projects and Project components can be created by an Administrator. The Administrator may choose whether to designate and make Content public, limited access or private. If an Administrator wishes to send you an invitation to participate in a Project or Project component, the Administrator or COS will send you an email. Once you accept the invitation, your personal profile information may be made available to others collaborating on the Project, subject to the specific privacy access restrictions imposed by the Administrator of your Project.</p><p>(a) Public. Content originally designated by the Administrator as \"Public\" will be available to the public. If you accept an invitation to participate in a Project, your personal profile information may be shared with the general public.</p><p>(b) Limited Access. Content marked as \"Limited Access\" may be viewed through our Websites and Services by the Project Administrator, a Proxy, a Contributing User, an Active or Passive User, and a Trusted Party, subject to the restrictions imposed by the Administrator.</p><p>(c) Private. Content marked as \"Private\" may be viewed only by those specifically designated by the Administrator.</p><p>If an Administrator changes the privacy settings of a Project, those changes will be applied prospectively. For example, if an Administrator changes a privacy setting from \"Public\" to \"Private\" or \"Limited Access\", there is no way for COS to restrict people who have previously viewed or downloaded the previously publicly accessible Content from using it.</p></li><li>HOW WE USE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION\r\n<p>When you register with COS, you acknowledge that information you provide on your membership profile may be seen by others and used by COS as described in this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use.</p><p>(a) Consent to COS to Use Personal Information.</p><p>COS may use personal information you supply to provide services that support the activities of the organization, its members, and their collaboration on Projects. When accessing the Websites, your personal user information may be tracked by COS in order to support collaboration, ensure authorized access, and enable communication between collaborators.</p><p>The personal information you may provide to COS may reveal or allow others to discern aspects of your life that are not expressly stated in your profile (for example, your picture or your name may reveal your gender). By providing personal information to us when you create or update your account and profile, you are expressly and voluntarily accepting the terms and conditions of our Terms of Use and freely accepting and agreeing to our processing of your personal information in ways set out by this Privacy Policy. Supplying information to us, including any information deemed \"sensitive\" by applicable law, is entirely voluntary on your part. You may withdraw your consent to COS's collection and processing of your information by changing or closing your account.</p><p>(b) Communications from COS.</p><p>We use the information you provide to customize your experience on the site. We may communicate with you using email or other means available to us regarding the availability of services, service-related issues, or announcements that we believe may be of interest to you. We may, for example, send you welcome messages and emails regarding new features or services, and promotional information from COS. You may opt out of receiving promotional messages from COS by following the instructions contained in the email. As long as you're a registered user, however, you can't opt out of receiving service messages from us. COS may also use personal information in order to customize content on the site to you, such as news relevant to you or to your industry or company.</p><p>(c) Communications from Others.</p><p>Personal contact information may be provided to other members of a Project on a secure site to encourage and facilitate collaboration, research, and the free exchange of information. Please remember that any information (including personal information) that you disclose on the public sections of our Websites, such as forums, message boards, and news groups, becomes public information that others may collect, circulate, and use. Because we cannot and do not control the acts of others, you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose information about yourself or others in public forums such as these.</p><p>(d) Sharing Information with Third Parties.</p><p>COS may share your personal information with our vendors, agents or contractors, such as a vendor that may host COS's servers, but only on a \"need to know\" basis to help us operate our Websites and Services. By providing us with your personal information during the user registration process and by agreeing to the terms of this Privacy Policy, you expressly consent to our storing, processing, and distributing your information for these purposes.</p><p>Information you put on your profile and any messages or comments you post on the public areas of our Websites may be seen by others. In keeping with our open process, COS may maintain publicly accessible archives of Projects for which the privacy level is designated as or amended to \"Public\" by the Administrator. In addition, should you post a comment or send an email to any of COS's hosted mail lists or discussion forums, subscribe to one of our newsletters or register for one of our public meetings, your email address may become part of the publicly accessible archives.</p><p>Information on our Websites may result in display of some of your personal information outside of COS. For example, when you post messages or comments that are open for public review and/or discussion, your profile information, including your name as the contributor and your email address, may be displayed in public search engine results. Similarly, if you post to public areas of our Websites using a Public API such as Twitter, Facebook, or Google Groups, your account profiles associated with these third party products may be displayed to the public. Your public profile also may be indexed and displayed through public search engines when someone searches for your name on our Websites.</p><p>You are responsible for any information you post on our Websites, and, subject to our Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, this information may be accessible to others. Accordingly, you should be aware that any information you choose to disclose on our Websites or Services may be read, collected, and used by other users within COS, and in the case of Projects and forums open to the public, by third parties. COS is not responsible for the information you choose to submit on our Websites.</p><p>COS does not rent or sell or otherwise distribute personal information that you have shared with us, except as permitted in this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use. We will not disclose personal information that is associated with your profile unless COS has a good faith belief that disclosure is permitted by law or is reasonably necessary to: (1) comply with a legal requirement or process, including, but not limited to, civil and criminal subpoenas, court orders or other compulsory disclosures; (2) investigate and enforce this Privacy Policy or our Terms Use; (3) respond to claims of a violation of the rights of third parties; (4) respond to member service inquiries; (5) protect the rights, property, or safety of COS, our users, or the public; or (6) as part of the sale of the assets of COS or as a change in control of the organization or one of its affiliates or in preparation for any of these events. COS reserves the right to supply any such information to any organization into which COS may merge in the future or to which it may make any transfer in order to enable a third party to continue part or all of the organization's mission. Any third party to which COS transfers or sells its assets will have the right to use the personal and other information that you provide in the manner set out in this Privacy Policy.</p></li><li>DATA TRANSFER\r\n<p>COS may store and process personal information on servers or on a cloud located outside of the country where you originally deposited data. The data protection laws of the country or countries where this personal information will be stored or processed might not be as comprehensive as those in your country. If you are unsure whether this Privacy Policy is in conflict with applicable local rules, you should not submit your information. If you are located within the European Union, you should note that your information will be transferred to the United States, which is deemed by the European Union to have inadequate data protection. By using our Websites and/or directly providing personal information to us, you hereby agree to and acknowledge your understanding of the terms of this Privacy Policy, and consent to have your personal data transferred to and processed in the United States and/or in other jurisdictions as determined by COS, notwithstanding your country of origin, or country, state and/or province of residence.</p></li><li>GOVERNING LAW\r\n<p>This Privacy Policy is governed in all respects by the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia, excluding that state's conflicts of laws provisions. Any action or proceeding arising out of or related to this Policy or your use of the Websites or Services must be brought in the state or federal courts of the Commonwealth of Virginia, and you consent to the exclusive personal jurisdiction and venue of such courts. Any cause of action you may have with respect to this Policy or your use of the Websites or Services must be commenced within one (1) year after the claim or cause of action arises.</p></li><li>YOUR OPT-OUT OPTIONS\r\n<p>You may access, modify, correct, or delete your personal information controlled by COS regarding your profile, and you may close your account. You can also contact us for any account information which is not on your profile or readily accessible to you. If you close your account, some or all of your profile information may continue to remain visible on the Websites.</p><p>You should be aware that information that you've shared with others or that others have copied may also remain visible after you have closed your account or deleted the information from your own profile. In addition, you may not be able to access, correct, or eliminate any information about you that other users have copied or exported out of the Websites, because this information may not be in our organization's control. Your public profile may be displayed in search engine results.</p><p>From time to time COS may email you electronic newsletters, announcements, surveys or other information unrelated to any Project. If you prefer not to receive any or all of these communications, you may opt out by following the directions provided within the electronic newsletters and announcements. COS also may conduct polls and surveys of our users, and your participation in this type of research is at your sole discretion. COS may follow up with you regarding your participation in this research. You may at any time opt out of participating in these polls and surveys.</p><p>Further, COS may send you occasional Service-related emails that you may not opt-out of (e.g. changes or updates to features of our Services that have security or privacy implications, technical and security notices, account verification).</p></li><li>DATA RETENTION\r\n<p>We will keep your personal information for as long as your account is active or as needed to comply with our legal obligations, even after you've closed your account, such as to meet regulatory requirements, resolve disputes between users, to prevent fraud and abuse, or to enforce this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use. We may be required to retain personal information for a limited period of time if requested by law enforcement. We also may retain indefinitely non-personally identifiable, aggregate data to facilitate our ongoing operations.</p></li><li>CONTACTING US\r\n<p>Questions about this Privacy Policy can be directed to <a href=\"mailto:contact@centerforopenscience.org\">contact@centerforopenscience.org</a>. Support is provided in English only.</p><p>This Privacy Policy was last updated on August 11, 2014.</p></li></ol>"
