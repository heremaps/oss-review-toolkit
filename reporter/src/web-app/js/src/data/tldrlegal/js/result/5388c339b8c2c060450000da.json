Propagation includes copying,</p><p>distribution (with or without modification and with or without charging</p><p>a redistribution fee), making available to the public, and in some</p><p>countries other activities as well.</p><p>PERMISSION & CONDITIONS</p><p>This licence does not grant any rights under trademark law and all such</p><p>rights are reserved.</p><p>Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a</p><p>copy of the Font Software, to propagate the Font Software, subject to</p><p>the below conditions:</p><p>1) Each copy of the Font Software must contain the above copyright</p><p>notice and this licence. These can be included either as stand-alone</p><p>text files, human-readable headers or in the appropriate machine-</p><p>readable metadata fields within text or binary files as long as those</p><p>fields can be easily viewed by the user.</p><p>2) The font name complies with the following:</p><p>(a) The Original Version must retain its name, unmodified.</p><p>(b) Modified Versions which are Substantially Changed must be renamed to</p><p>avoid use of the name of the Original Version or similar names entirely.</p><p>(c) Modified Versions which are not Substantially Changed must be</p><p>renamed to both (i) retain the name of the Original Version and (ii) add</p><p>additional naming elements to distinguish the Modified Version from the</p><p>Original Version. The name of such Modified Versions must be the name of</p><p>the Original Version, with \"derivative X\" where X represents the name of</p><p>the new work, appended to that name.</p><p>3) The name(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) and any contributor to the</p><p>Font Software shall not be used to promote, endorse or advertise any</p><p>Modified Version, except (i) as required by this licence, (ii) to</p><p>acknowledge the contribution(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) or (iii) with</p><p>their explicit written permission.</p><p>4) The Font Software, modified or unmodified, in part or in whole, must</p><p>be distributed entirely under this licence, and must not be distributed</p><p>under any other licence.
