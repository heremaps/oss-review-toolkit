# Introduction

The goal of the OSS Review Toolkit (ORT) is to verify Free and Open Source Software licence compliance by checking
project source code and dependencies.

At a high level, it works by analyzing the source code for dependencies, downloading the
source code of the dependencies, scanning all source code for license information, and summarizing the results.

The different tools that make up ORT are designed as libraries (for programmatic use) with minimal command line
interfaces (for scripted use, 
[doing one thing and doing it well](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy#Do_One_Thing_and_Do_It_Well)).

The toolkit is envisioned to consist of the following libraries:

* *Analyzer* - determines dependencies of a software project even when multiple package managers are used. No changes to
  software project required.
* *Downloader* - fetches the source code based on output generated by the Analyzer.
* *Scanner* - wrapper around existing copyright / license scanners which takes as input the output of the Downloader and
  produces standardized output such as [SPDX](https://spdx.org/).
* *Evaluator* * - Evaluates the scan results from Scanner as OK or NOT OK based on user specified approval / rejection
  ruleset.
* *Advisor* * - Retrieves security advisories based on Analyzer results.
* *Reporter* * - Summarizes the output from Analyzer, Scanner and Evaluator in an interactive UI that shows the
  identified copyrights, licenses and NOT OK issues.
* *Documenter* * - Generates the outcome of the review, e.g. Open Source notices and annotated [SPDX](https://spdx.org/)
  files that can be included with your deliverable.

\* Libraries to be completed by Q3 2018.

## Installation

Follow these steps to get started with the OSS Review Toolkit:

1. Ensure OpenJDK 8 or Oracle JDK 8u161 or later (not the JRE as you need the `javac` compiler) is installed and the
   `JAVA_HOME` environment variable set.
2. Clone this repository *recursively*, i.e. with submodules (`git clone --recurse-submodules`).
3. Change into the repo directory on your machine and run `./gradlew installDist` to setup the build environment (e.g.
   get Gradle etc.) and build / install the start scripts for ORT. The individual start scripts can then be run directly
   from their respective locations as follows:

* `./analyzer/build/install/analyzer/bin/analyzer`
* `./graph/build/install/graph/bin/graph`
* `./downloader/build/install/downloader/bin/downloader`
* `./scanner/build/install/scanner/bin/scanner`

Make sure that the locale of your system is set to `en_US.UTF-8`, using other locales might lead to issues with parsing
the output of external tools.

## Supported package managers

Currently, the following package managers / build systems can be detected and queried for their managed dependencies:

* [Bundler](http://bundler.io/)
* [dep](https://golang.github.io/dep/)
* [Glide](https://glide.sh/)
* [Godep](https://github.com/tools/godep)
* [Gradle](https://gradle.org/)
* [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/)
* [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) / [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
* [PHP Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)
* [PIP](https://pip.pypa.io/)
* [SBT](http://www.scala-sbt.org/)

## Supported license scanners

ORT comes with some example implementations for wrappers around license / copyright scanners:

* [Askalono](https://github.com/amzn/askalono)
* [lc](https://github.com/boyter/lc)
* [Licensee](https://github.com/benbalter/licensee)
* [ScanCode](https://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit)

## Supported remote caches

For reusing already known scan results, ORT can currently use one of the following backends as a remote cache:

* [Artifactory](https://jfrog.com/artifactory/)

## Usage

### [analyzer](../analyzer/src/main/kotlin)

The Analyzer determines the dependencies of software projects inside the specified input directory (`-i`). It does so by
querying whatever [supported package manager](../analyzer/src/main/kotlin/managers) is found. No modifications to your
existing project source code, or especially to the build system, are necessary for that to work. The tree of transitive
dependencies per project is written out as [ABCD](https://github.com/nexB/aboutcode/tree/master/aboutcode-data)-style
YAML (or JSON, see `-f`) files to the specified output directory (`-o`) whose inner structure mirrors the one from the
input directory. The output files exactly document the status quo of all package-related meta-data. They can and
probably need to be further processed or manually edited before passing them to one of the other tools.

### [graph](../graph/src/main/kotlin)

In order to quickly visualize dependency information from an analysis the Graph tool can be used. Given a dependencies
file (`-d`) it diplays a simple representation of the dependency graph in a GUI. The graph is interactive in the sense
that nodes can be dragged & dropped with the mouse to rearrange them for a better overview.

### [downloader](../downloader/src/main/kotlin)

Taking a single ABCD-syle dependencies file as the input (`-d`), the Downloader retrieves the source code of all
contained packages to the specified output directory (`-o`). The Downloader takes care of things like normalizing URLs
and using the [appropriate VCS tool](../downloader/src/main/kotlin/vcs) to checkout source code from version control.

### [scanner](../scanner/src/main/kotlin)

This tool wraps underlying license / copyright scanners with a common API. This way all supported scanners can be used
in the same way to easily run them and compare their results. If passed a dependencies analysis file (`-d`), the Scanner
will automatically download the sources of the dependencies via the Downloader and scan them afterwards. In order to not
download or scan any previously scanned sources, the Scanner can be configured (`-c`) to use a remote cache, hosted
e.g. on [Artifactory](../scanner/src/main/kotlin/ArtifactoryCache.kt) or S3 (not yet implemented). Using the example of
configuring an Artifactory cache, the YAML-based configuration file would look like:

```yaml
scanner:
  cache:
    type: Artifactory
    url: "https://artifactory.domain.com/artifactory/generic-repository-name"
    apiToken: $ARTIFACTORY_API_KEY
```

### [reporter](../reporter/src/main/kotlin)

The reporter generates human-readable reports from the scan-record file generated by the scanner (`-s`). It is designed
to support multiple output formats. Currently a static HTML report (`-f STATIC_HTML`) and an Excel report (`-f EXCEL`)
are supported.

## Getting Started

Please see [GettingStarted.md](./GettingStarted.md) for an introduction to the tools.

## Development

The toolkit is written in [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) and uses [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) as the build system.
We recommend the [IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/) as the IDE which can
directly import the Gradle build files.

The most important root project Gradle tasks are listed in the table below.

| Task        | Purpose                                                           |
