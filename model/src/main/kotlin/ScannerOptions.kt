/**
 * A base class representing an option to configure a scanner execution.
 *
 * The subclasses of this class represent logic options that influence the result produced by a scanner - independent
 * on a concrete scanner implementation. Such implementations have to map their specific options to these logic
 * classes. This allows the results of different scanner implementations to be compared for compatibility. When new
 * scanner implementations with new features and options are added this hierarchy has to be extended accordingly.
 * The primary use case of these classes is to determine whether a result found in a scan result storage can be used
 * instead of running a scanner again with a specific set of options.
 *
 * Because scanner options have a specific semantic it is in most cases not sufficient to match them exactly.
 * Therefore, this class defines a function that does a compatibility check. Here classes for concrete options can
 * implement their specific logic.
 *
 * The matching logic supports a strict and a lenient mode to cover different use cases. The strict mode guarantees
 * that scan results are considered compatible only if they contain (at least) all the data requested by the
 * options provided in the exact form. This is suitable if a specific scanner is used and the processing of the scan
 * result is sensitive to the concrete data it contains. In lenient mode in contrast a user merely specifies in what
 * kind of data he or she is interested (such as license or copyright information), but does not care from which
 * scanner this data was produced or how it might have been fine-tuned.

 * compared one to one to determine whether they are equivalent or compatible. Therefore, this enumeration defines a
 * (simple) model of sub options that can also be used to determine how to compare them.
 *
 * For instance, the ScanCode scanner has an option to include emails found in the source code into its result. There
 * is a sub option to define a maximum number of emails to return. When doing a compatibility check, this maximum
 * number does not need to match exactly, but it is sufficient if an existing result has at least the number of emails
