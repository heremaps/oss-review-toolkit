The OSS Review Toolkit (ORT for short) is a suite of tools to assist with reviewing Free and Open Source Software dependencies in your software. At a high level, it works by analyzing your source code for dependencies, downloading the source code of the dependencies, and scanning all source code for license information and summarizing the results. The different tools in the suite are designed as libraries (for programmatic use) with minimal command line interfaces (for scripted use, [doing one thing and doing it well](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy#Do_One_Thing_and_Do_It_Well)).

The goal of ORT is to give the Open Source community a toolset that can enable reviews during source code creation by providing open-sourced tooling for developers to do basic compliance checks and get insights on their dependencies.

The toolkit is envisioned to consist out of the following libraries:

* *Analyzer* - determines dependencies of software project even when multiple package managers are used. No changes to software project required.
* *Downloader* - fetches the source code based on output generated by the Analyzer.
* *Scanner* - wrapper around existing copyright/license scanners which takes as input the output of the Downloader and produces standardized output such as [SPDX](https://spdx.org/).
* *Evaluator* * - Evaluates the scan results from Scanner as OK or NOT OK based on user specified approval/rejection ruleset.
* *Advisor* * - Retrieves security advisories based on Analyzer results.
* *Reporter* * - Summarizes the output from Analyzer, Scanner and Evaluator in an interactive UI of found copyrights, licenses and NOT OK issues.
* *Documenter* * - Generates the outcome of the review, e.g. Open Source notices and annotated [SPDX](https://spdx.org/) files that can be included with your deliverable.

\* Libraries still to be implemented, plan is to have a complete MVP suite by Q3 2018.

## Installation

To get started with the OSS Review Toolkit, simply:

1. Ensure OpenJDK 8 or Oracle JDK 8u161 or later (not the JRE as you need the `javac` compiler) is installed and the `JAVA_HOME`
environment variable set.
2. Clone this repository.
3. Change into the repo directory on your machine and run `./gradlew installDist` to setup the build environment (e.g.
get Gradle etc.) and build/install the start scripts for ORT. The individual start scripts can then be run directly from
their respective locations as follows:

* `./analyzer/build/install/analyzer/bin/analyzer`
* `./graph/build/install/graph/bin/graph`
* `./downloader/build/install/downloader/bin/downloader`
* `./scanner/build/install/scanner/bin/scanner`

Make sure that the locale of your system is set to `en_US.UTF-8`, using other locales might lead to issues with parsing
the output of external tools.

## Supported package managers

Currently, the following package managers / build systems can be detected and queried for their managed dependencies:

* [Gradle](https://gradle.org/)
* [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/)
* [SBT](http://www.scala-sbt.org/)
* [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/)
* [PIP](https://pip.pypa.io/)

## Supported license scanners

ORT comes with some example implementations for wrappers around license / copyright scanners:

* [Licensee](https://github.com/benbalter/licensee)
* [ScanCode](https://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit)

## Usage

### [analyzer](./analyzer/src/main/kotlin)

The Analyzer determines the dependencies of software projects inside the specified input directory (`-i`). It does so by
querying whatever [supported package manager](./analyzer/src/main/kotlin/managers) is found. No modifications to your
existing project source code, or especially to the build system, are necessary for that to work. The tree of transitive
dependencies per project is written out as [ABCD](https://github.com/nexB/aboutcode/tree/master/aboutcode-data)-style
YAML (or JSON, see `-f`) files to the specified output directory (`-o`) whose inner structure mirrors the one from the
input directory. The output files exactly document the status quo of all package-related meta-data. They can and
probably need to be further processed or manually edited before passing them to one of the other tools.

The `analyzer` command line tool takes the following arguments:

```
Usage: analyzer [options]
  Options:
  * --input-dir, -i
      The project directory to scan.
  * --output-dir, -o
      The directory to write dependency information to.
    --package-curations-file
      A YAML file that contains package curation data.
    --ignore-versions
      Ignore versions of required tools. NOTE: This may lead to erroneous
      results.
      Default: false
    --merge-results
      Merge all results into a single results file. The individual scan
      results files for each build file will still be created.
      Default: false
    --allow-dynamic-versions
      Allow dynamic versions of dependencies. This can result in unstable
      results when dependencies use version ranges. This option only affects
      package managers that support lock files, like NPM.
      Default: false
    --package-managers, -m
      A list of package managers to activate.
      Default: [Gradle, Maven, SBT, NPM, PIP]
    --output-format, -f
      The data format used for dependency information.
      Default: YAML
      Possible Values: [JSON, YAML]
    --debug
      Enable debug logging and keep any temporary files.
      Default: false
    --stacktrace
      Print out the stacktrace for all exceptions.
      Default: false
    --info
      Enable info logging.
      Default: false
    --help, -h
      Display the command line help.
```

### [graph](./graph/src/main/kotlin)

In order to quickly visualize dependency information from an analysis the Graph tool can be used. Given a dependencies
file (`-d`) it diplays a simple representation of the dependency graph in a GUI. The graph is interactive in the sense
that nodes can be dragged & dropped with the mouse to rearrange them for a better overview.

The `graph` command line tool takes the following arguments:

```
Usage: graph [options]
  Options:
  * --dependencies-file, -d
      The dependencies analysis file to use.
    --info
      Enable info logging.
      Default: false
    --debug
      Enable debug logging and keep any temporary files.
      Default: false
    --stacktrace
      Print out the stacktrace for all exceptions.
      Default: false
    --help, -h
      Display the command line help.
```

### [downloader](./downloader/src/main/kotlin)

Taking a single ABCD-syle dependencies file as the input (`-d`), the Downloader retrieves the source code of all
contained packages to the specified output directory (`-o`). The Downloader takes care of things like normalizing URLs
and using the [appropriate VCS tool](./downloader/src/main/kotlin/vcs) to checkout source code from version control.

The `downloader` command line tool takes the following arguments:

```
Usage: downloader [options]
  Options:
  * --dependencies-file, -d
      The dependencies analysis file to use.
  * --output-dir, -o
      The output directory to download the source code to.
    --allow-moving-revisions
      Allow the download of moving revisions (like e.g. HEAD or master in
      Git). By default these revision are forbidden because they are not
      pointing to a stable revision of the source code.
      Default: false
    --entities, -e
      The data entities from the dependencies analysis file to download.
      Default: [PACKAGES, PROJECT]
    --debug
      Enable debug logging and keep any temporary files.
      Default: false
    --info
      Enable info logging.
      Default: false
    --stacktrace
      Print out the stacktrace for all exceptions.
      Default: false
    --help, -h
      Display the command line help.
```

### [scanner](./scanner/src/main/kotlin)

This tool wraps underlying license / copyright scanners with a common API. This way all supported scanners can be used
in the same way to easily run them and compare their results. If passed a dependencies analysis file (`-d`), the Scanner
will automatically download the sources of the dependencies via the Downloader and scan them afterwards. In order to not
download or scan any previously scanned sources, the Scanner can be configured (`-c`) to use a (remote) cache, hosted
e.g. on [Artifactory](./scanner/src/main/kotlin/ArtifactoryCache.kt) or S3 (not yet implemented). Using the example of
configuring an Artifactory cache, the YAML-based configuration file would look like:

```
scanner:
  cache:
    type: Artifactory
    url: "https://artifactory.domain.com/artifactory/generic-repository-name"
    apiToken: $ARTIFACTORY_API_KEY
```

The `scanner` command line tool takes the following arguments:

```
Usage: scanner [options]
  Options:
  * --output-dir, -o
      The output directory to store the scan results in.
    --summary-format, -f
      The list of file formats for the summary files.
      Default: [YAML]
    --dependencies-file, -d
      The dependencies analysis file to use. Source code will be downloaded
      automatically if needed. This parameter and --input-path are mutually
      exclusive.
    --input-path, -i
      The input directory or file to scan. This parameter and
      --dependencies-file are mutually exclusive.
    --download-dir
      The output directory for downloaded source code. Defaults to
      <output-dir>/downloads.
    --scopes
      The list of scopes that shall be scanned. Works only with the
      --dependencies-file parameter. If empty, all scopes are scanned.
      Default: []
    --scanner, -s
      The scanner to use.
      Default: ScanCode
    --config, -c
      The path to the configuration file.
    --info
      Enable info logging.
      Default: false
    --debug
      Enable debug logging and keep any temporary files.
      Default: false
    --stacktrace
      Print out the stacktrace for all exceptions.
      Default: false
    --help, -h
      Display the command line help.
```

## Development

The toolkit is written in [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) and uses [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) as the build system.
We recommend the [IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/) as the IDE which can
directly import the Gradle build files.
